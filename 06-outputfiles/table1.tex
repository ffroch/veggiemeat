\textsuperscript{1}Protein basis of the examined product. Only pea or soybean protein products were selected for the study.\\
\textsuperscript{2}product designation. Products with a minced 'meat' basis (i.e. minced meat, burger, cevapcici, sausages) were additionally classified as 'minced', products immitating pieces of meat or a meat structure (i.e. fillets, steaks, chunks, kebab) were classified as 'fibrous'.\\
\textsuperscript{3}days to expiration date (ed) or best before date (bbd) at sampling. In brackets: consume within x days after opening.\\
\textsuperscript{4}Recommended cooking time. If label said (e.g.) 2 minutes per side, the recommended cooking time were doubled to 4 minutes for this table. \\
