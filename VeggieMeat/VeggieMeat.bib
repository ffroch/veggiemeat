 abstract = {Previously, a considerable underestimation (+0.5-3.2~log CFU/g) on the contamination levels of psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was observed for 33 retail, packaged food products stored at chilling temperature when the mesophilic enumeration technique was implemented as reference shelf-life parameter. In the present study, the microbial diversity of the dominant psychrotrophic LAB recovered after incubation of plates at 22~°C for 5 days was determined using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. A total of 212 LAB isolates were identified using a combination of rep-PCR fingerprinting, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis and pheS gene sequencing. Leuconostoc gasicomitatum, Leuconostoc gelidum, Leuconostoc spp., Lactococcus piscium and Lactobacillus algidus proved to be the most competent and predominant species that may go undetected by the widely applied mesophilic enumeration protocols (ISO 4833:2003 and ISO 15214:1998). This study has assessed the interspecific variation among potential spoilage LAB, and highlights the significance of implementing a reference shelf-life parameter based on the enumeration of the total psychrotrophic bacterial load for industrial microbiological routine analyses.},

 abstract = {Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people live primarily on a meat-based diet, while an estimated 4 billion live primarily on a plant-based diet. The US food production system uses about 50{\%} of the total US land area, 80{\%} of the fresh water, and 17{\%} of the fossil energy used in the country. The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable. The use of land and energy resources devoted to an average meat-based diet compared with a lactoovovegetarian (plant-based) diet is analyzed in this report. In both diets, the daily quantity of calories consumed are kept constant at about 3533 kcal per person. The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet. In this limited sense, the lactoovovegetarian diet is more sustainable than the average American meat-based diet.},

@article{Pickett.2021,
 abstract = {Despite the strength of arguments for veganism in the animal rights literature, alongside environmental and other anthropocentric concerns posed by industrialised animal agriculture, veganism remains only a minority standpoint. In this paper, I explore the moral motivational problem of veganism from the perspectives of moral psychology and political false consciousness. I argue that a novel interpretation of the post-Marxist notion of political false consciousness may help to make sense of the widespread refusal to shift towards veganism. Specifically, the notion of false consciousness fills some explanatory gaps left by the moral psychological notion of akrasia, often understood to refer to a weakness of will. Central to my approach is the idea that animal exploitation is largely systemic and the assumption that moral motivation is inseparable from moral thinking. In this light, the primary obstacle to the adoption of veganism arises not so much from a failure to put genuine beliefs into action, but rather in a shared, distorted way of thinking about animals. Thus, common unreflective objections to veganism may be said to be manifestations of false consciousness.},

@article{Parkin.2011,
 abstract = {This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7{\%} of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3{\%} in men, 40.1{\%} in women)--a total of about 134,000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60, 000 cases (19.4{\%} of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1{\%}), occupational exposures (4.9{\%}) and alcohol consumption (4.6{\%}) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)--responsible for 6.9{\%} of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7{\%}).Population-attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level.},

@article{Park.2012,
 abstract = {Kimchi, a food made of fermented vegetables, is densely populated by indigenous microorganisms that originate from the raw ingredients under normal conditions. Most microbiological studies on kimchi have been on the most popular dish, baechu-kimchi (Chinese cabbage kimchi). Therefore, relatively little is known about the various other kinds of kimchi (depending on the region, season, main ingredient, starter culture inoculation and recipe). In this study, we collected 100 samples periodically during the fermentation of ten representative kinds of kimchi (including starter-inoculated kimchi) that were stored in the refrigerator (4~°C) during the 30-35 days fermentation period. The multiplex barcoded pyrosequencing of a hypervariable V1-V3 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene tagged with sample-specific barcodes for multiplex identifiers was employed for bacterial community profiling. We found that bacterial communities differed between starter-inoculated and non-inoculated kimchi at the early stages of fermentation, but overall there were no significant differences in the late phases. Also, the diversity and richness of bacterial communities varied depending on the various types of kimchi, and these differences could largely be explained by the major ingredients and the manufacture processes of each types of kimchi. This study provides the comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the biodiversity of the kimchi ecosystem.},

L. sakei probio-65 was isolated from kimchi, a traditional Korean fermented food. This strain was resistant to gastric acidity, bile, and several antibiotics and possessed antimicrobial activity against several pathogenic microorganisms. To investigate whether the probiotic activity of L. sakei probio 65 was effective for treating allergic dermatitis, the organism was supplied to mice triggered by allergen (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). Mice that received L. sakei probio 65 showed a more rapid recovery compared to control mice, as assessed by visual evaluation of the severity of allergic dermatitis and levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) E and interleukin (IL)-4. L. sakei probio 65 exhibited good probiotic properties in vitro and in mice and was effective in reducing allergen-induced skin inflammation through the regulation of both elevated IgE and IL-4 in sensitized mice.},

@article{Palanisamy.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

High moisture extrusion (HME) of lupin protein concentrate and isolate (50:50) mixture was performed by varying the extrusion parameters, such as barrel temperature (138-180 °C), water feed (40-68{\%}) and screw speed (400-1800 rpm). The effect of extrusion parameters on extruder responses [die pressure, product temperature, torque and specific mechanical energy (SME)] and product properties [colour, cutting force, cooking yield, microstructure and in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD)] was evaluated.

RESULTS

The multiple regression analysis of the results revealed that the water feed had a significant negative linear effect on the extruder responses considered, as well as on colour difference and cutting force of extrudates. Screw speed had a positive linear effect on product temperature, SME and cooking yield. Barrel temperature affected extruder responses and product properties to a lesser extent. Scanning electron microscopy showed that denser microstructure and higher number of fibre layers were created by increasing temperature and screw speed along with decreasing water feed. The results of IVPD of selected extrudates showed that the increase in barrel temperature decreased the IVPD, whereas the increase in water feed resulted in higher IVPD. The screw speed had no significant effect on IVPD.

CONCLUSION

The study demonstrates that the use of lupin protein is feasible to produce meat analogues with HME which could enhance the possibilities to meet the growing protein demands for human consumption. {\copyright} 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.},

@article{Quijada.2019,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION

The progress of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies and the reduction in the sequencing costs are such that Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) could replace many traditional laboratory assays and procedures. Exploiting the volume of data produced by HTS platforms requires substantial computing skills and this is the main bottleneck in the implementation of WGS as a routine laboratory technique. The way in which the vast amount of results are presented to researchers and clinicians with no specialist knowledge of genome sequencing is also a significant issue.

RESULTS

Here we present TORMES, a user-friendly pipeline for WGS analysis of bacteria from any origin generated by HTS on Illumina platforms. TORMES is designed for non-bioinformatician users, and automates the steps required for WGS analysis directly from the raw sequence data: sequence quality filtering, de novo assembly, draft genome ordering against a reference, genome annotation, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), searching for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, and pangenome comparisons. Once the analysis is finished, TORMES generates and interactive web-like report that can be opened in any web browser and shared and revised by researchers in a simple manner. TORMES can be run by using very simple commands and represent a quick an easy way to perform WGS analysis.

 abstract = {Nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference databases are critical resources for widespread applications including marker-gene and metagenome sequencing for microbiome analysis, diet metabarcoding, and environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys. Reproducibly generating, managing, using, and evaluating nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference databases creates a significant bottleneck for researchers aiming to generate custom sequence databases. Furthermore, database composition drastically influences results, and lack of standardization limits cross-study comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed RESCRIPt, a Python 3 software package and QIIME 2 plugin for reproducible generation and management of reference sequence taxonomy databases, including dedicated functions that streamline creating databases from popular sources, and functions for evaluating, comparing, and interactively exploring qualitative and quantitative characteristics across reference databases. To highlight the breadth and capabilities of RESCRIPt, we provide several examples for working with popular databases for microbiome profiling (SILVA, Greengenes, NCBI-RefSeq, GTDB), eDNA and diet metabarcoding surveys (BOLD, GenBank), as well as for genome comparison. We show that bigger is not always better, and reference databases with standardized taxonomies and those that focus on type strains have quantitative advantages, though may not be appropriate for all use cases. Most databases appear to benefit from some curation (quality filtering), though sequence clustering appears detrimental to database quality. Finally, we demonstrate the breadth and extensibility of RESCRIPt for reproducible workflows with a comparison of global hepatitis genomes. RESCRIPt provides tools to democratize the process of reference database acquisition and management, enabling researchers to reproducibly and transparently create reference materials for diverse research applications.

 abstract = {Soy is a basic food ingredient of traditional Asian cuisine used for thousands of years. In Western countries, soybeans have been introduced about a hundred years ago and recently they are mainly used for surrogate foods production. Soy and soy foods are common nutritional solutions for vegetarians, due to their high protein content and versatility in the production of meat analogues and milk substitutes. However, there are some doubts about the potential effects on health, such as the effectiveness on cardiovascular risk reduction or, conversely, on the possible disruption of thyroid function and sexual hormones. The soy components that have stimulated the most research interest are isoflavones, which are polyphenols with estrogenic properties highly contained in soybeans. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of soy and soy foods, focusing on their nutrient content, including phytoestrogens and other bioactive substances that are noteworthy for vegetarians, the largest soy consumers in the Western countries. The safety of use will also be discussed, given the growing trend in adoption of vegetarian styles and the new soy-based foods availability. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.

@article{Ritter.2021,
 abstract = {Species may co-occur due to responses to similar environmental conditions, biological associations, or simply because of coincident geographical distributions. Disentangling patterns of co-occurrence and potential biotic and abiotic interactions is crucial to understand ecosystem function. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding data from litter and mineral soils collected from a longitudinal transect in Amazonia to explore patterns of co-occurrence. We compared data from different Amazonian habitat types, each with a characteristic biota and environmental conditions. These included non-flooded rainforests (terra-firme), forests seasonally flooded by fertile white waters (v{\'a}rzeas) or by unfertile black waters (igap{\'o}s), and open areas associated with white sand soil (campinas). We ran co-occurrence network analyses based on null models and Spearman correlation for all samples and for each habitat separately. We found that one third of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were bacteria and two thirds were eukaryotes. The resulting networks were nevertheless mostly composed of bacteria, with fewer fungi, protists, and metazoans. Considering the functional traits of the OTUs, there is a combination of metabolism modes including respiration and fermentation for bacteria, and a high frequency of saprotrophic fungi (those that feed on dead organic matter), indicating a high turnover of organic material. The organic carbon and base saturation indices were important in the co-occurrences in Amazonian networks, whereas several other soil properties were important for the co-exclusion. Different habitats had similar network properties with some variation in terms of modularity, probably associated with flooding pulse. We show that Amazonian microorganism communities form highly interconnected co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks, which highlights the importance of complex biotic and abiotic interactions in explaining the outstanding biodiversity of the region.},

 abstract = {Microorganisms from all domains of life establish associations with plants. Although some harm the plant, others antagonize pathogens or prime the plant immune system, support the acquisition of nutrients, tune plant hormone levels, or perform additional services. Most culture-independent plant microbiome research has focused on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and/or the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rRNA genomic loci, which show the relative abundance of the microbes to each other. Here, we describe shotgun sequencing of 275 wild Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbiomes from southwest Germany, with additional bacterial 16S and eukaryotic ITS1 rRNA amplicon data from 176 of these samples. Shotgun data, which unlike the amplicon data capture the ratio of microbe to plant DNA, enable scaling of microbial read abundances to reflect the microbial load on the host. In a more cost-effective hybrid strategy, we show they also allow a similar scaling of amplicon data to overcome compositionality problems. Our wild plants were dominated by bacterial sequences, with eukaryotes contributing only a minority of reads. Microbial membership showed weak associations with both site of origin and plant genotype, both of which were highly confounded in this dataset. There was large variation among microbiomes, with one extreme comprising samples of low complexity and a high load of microorganisms typical of infected plants, and the other extreme being samples of high complexity and a low microbial load. Critically, considering absolute microbial load led to fundamentally different conclusions about microbiome assembly and the interaction networks among major taxa.},

According to EC Recommendation 2004/24/EC and European Spice Association specifications, 96{\%} of 2833 retail samples and 92{\%} of 132 production batches were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. Salmonella spp. were detected in 1.5{\%} and 1.1{\%} of dried spices and herbs sampled at production and retail, respectively. Overall, 3.0{\%} of herbs and spices contained high counts of Bacillus cereus (1{\%}, {\textgreater} or =10(5) cfu g(-1)), Clostridium perfringens (0.4{\%}, {\textgreater} or =10(3) cfu g(-1)) and/or Escherichia coli (2.1{\%}, {\textgreater} or =10(2) cfu g(-1)). Ninety percent of samples examined were recorded as being 'ready-to-use', 96{\%} of which were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. The potential public health risk of using spices and herbs as an addition to ready-to-eat foods that potentially undergo no further processing is therefore highlighted in this study. Prevention of microbial contamination in dried herbs and spices lies in the application of good hygiene practices during growing, harvesting and processing from farm to fork, and effective decontamination. In addition, the importance of correct food handling practices and usage of herbs and spices by end users cannot be overemphasised.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Meat consumption is inconsistently associated with development of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and diabetes mellitus, limiting quantitative recommendations for consumption levels. Effects of meat intake on these different outcomes, as well as of red versus processed meat, may also vary.

METHODS AND RESULTS

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence for relationships of red (unprocessed), processed, and total meat consumption with incident CHD, stroke, and diabetes mellitus. We searched for any cohort study, case-control study, or randomized trial that assessed these exposures and outcomes in generally healthy adults. Of 1598 identified abstracts, 20 studies met inclusion criteria, including 17 prospective cohorts and 3 case-control studies. All data were abstracted independently in duplicate. Random-effects generalized least squares models for trend estimation were used to derive pooled dose-response estimates. The 20 studies included 1 218 380 individuals and 23 889 CHD, 2280 stroke, and 10 797 diabetes mellitus cases. Red meat intake was not associated with CHD (n=4 studies; relative risk per 100-g serving per day=1.00; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.23; P for heterogeneity=0.36) or diabetes mellitus (n=5; relative risk=1.16; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.46; P=0.25). Conversely, processed meat intake was associated with 42{\%} higher risk of CHD (n=5; relative risk per 50-g serving per day=1.42; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.89; P=0.04) and 19{\%} higher risk of diabetes mellitus (n=7; relative risk=1.19; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.27; P{\textless}0.001). Associations were intermediate for total meat intake. Consumption of red and processed meat were not associated with stroke, but only 3 studies evaluated these relationships.

CONCLUSIONS

Consumption of processed meats, but not red meats, is associated with higher incidence of CHD and diabetes mellitus. These results highlight the need for better understanding of potential mechanisms of effects and for particular focus on processed meats for dietary and policy recommendations.},

 abstract = {The impact of meat product recall events on consumer demand (beef, pork, poultry, and other consumption goods) in the USA is tested empirically. Beef, pork, and poultry recall indices are constructed from both the Food Safety Inspection Service's meat recall events and from newspaper reports over the period 1982-1998. Following previous product recall studies, recall indices are incorporated as shift variables in consumers' demand functions. Estimating an absolute price version of the Rotterdam demand model, findings indicate that Food Safety Inspection Service's meat recall events significantly impact demand, and newspaper reports do not. Moreover, although elasticities related to recall events are significant they are small in magnitude relative to price and income effects. Any favourable effects on the demands of meat substitutes for a recall are offset by a more general negative effect on meat demand. The general negative effect indicates a shift out of meat to non-meat consumption goods. {\copyright} 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

 abstract = {The viability of Shiga toxin--producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes within plant- and beef-based burgers was monitored during storage and cooking. When inoculated (ca. 3.5 log CFU/g) into 15-g portions of plant- or beef-based burgers, levels of STEC and Salmonella decreased slightly ($\leq$0.5-log decrease) in both types of burgers when stored at 48C, but increased ca. 2.4 and 0.8 log CFU/g, respectively, in plant-based burgers but not beef-based burgers ($\leq$1.2-log decrease), after 21 days at 108C. For L. monocytogenes, levels increased by ca. 1.3 and 2.6 log CFU/g in plant burgers after 21 days at 4 and 108C, respectively, whereas pathogen levels decreased slightly ($\leq$0.9-log decrease) in beef burgers during storage at 4 and 108C. Regarding cooking, burgers (ca. 114 g each) were inoculated with ca. 7.0 log CFU/g STEC, Salmonella, or L. monocytogenes and cooked in a saut{\'e} pan. Cooking plant- or beef-based burgers to 62.88C (1458F), 68.38C (1558F), or 73.98C (1658F) delivered reductions ranging from ca. 4.7 to 6.8 log CFU/g for STEC, ca. 4.4 to 7.0 log CFU/g for L. monocytogenes, and ca. 3.5 to 6.7 log CFU/g for Salmonella. In summary, the observation that levels of all three pathogens increased by ca. 1.0 to ca. 2.5 log CFU/g in plant-based burgers when stored at an abusive temperature (108C) highlights the importance of proper storage (48C) to lessen risk. However, because all three pathogens responded similarly to heat in plant-based as in beef-based burgers, well-established cooking parameters required to eliminate STEC, Salmonella, or L. monocytogenes from ground beef should be as effective for controlling cells of these same pathogens in a burger made with plant-sourced protein. {\copyright} 2020 International Association for Food Protection.

 abstract = {Soy protein, mixed with gluten and starch, was extruded into fibrous meat analogues under high-moisture and high-temperature conditions. The protein solubility of samples collected at different extruder zones and extrudates made with different moistures was determined by 11 extraction solutions consisting of 6 selective reagents and their combinations: phosphate salts, urea, DTT, thiourea, Triton X-100, and CHAPS. Protein solubility by most extractants showed decreasing patterns as the material passed through the extruder, but the solution containing all 6 reagents, known as isoelectric focus (IEF) buffer, solubilized the highest levels and equal amounts of proteins in all samples, indicating that there are no other covalent bonds involved besides disulfide bonds. With regard to relative importance between disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions, different conclusions could be made from protein solubility patterns, depending on the type of extracting systems and a baseline used for comparison. The observation points out pitfalls and limitation of current protein solubility methodology and explains why controversy exists in the literature. Using the IEF buffer system with omission of one or more selective reagents is considered to be the right methodology to conduct protein solubility study and thus recommended. Results obtained with this system indicate that disulfide bonding plays a more important role than non-covalent bonds in not only holding the rigid structure of extrudates but also forming fibrous texture. The sharpest decrease in protein solubility occurred when the mix passed through the intermediate section of the extruder barrel, indicating formation of new disulfide bonds during the stage of dramatic increase in both temperature and moisture. After this stage, although the physical form of the product might undergo change and fiber formation might occur as it passed through the cooling die, the chemical nature of the product did not change significantly.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Bacterial load quantification is a critical component of bacterial community analysis, but a culture-independent method capable of detecting and quantifying diverse bacteria is needed. Based on our analysis of a diverse collection of 16 S rRNA gene sequences, we designed a broad-coverage quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay--BactQuant--for quantifying 16 S rRNA gene copy number and estimating bacterial load. We further utilized in silico evaluation to complement laboratory-based qPCR characterization to validate BactQuant.

METHODS

The aligned core set of 4,938 16 S rRNA gene sequences in the Greengenes database were analyzed for assay design. Cloned plasmid standards were generated and quantified using a qPCR-based approach. Coverage analysis was performed computationally using {\textgreater}670,000 sequences and further evaluated following the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines.

RESULTS

A bacterial TaqMan{\circledR} qPCR assay targeting a 466 bp region in V3-V4 was designed. Coverage analysis showed that 91{\%} of the phyla, 96{\%} of the genera, and {\textgreater}80{\%} of the 89,537 species analyzed contained at least one perfect sequence match to the BactQuant assay. Of the 106 bacterial species evaluated, amplification efficiencies ranged from 81 to 120{\%}, with r2-value of {\textgreater}0.99, including species with sequence mismatches. Inter- and intra-run coefficient of variance was {\textless}3{\%} and {\textless}16{\%} for Ct and copy number, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS

The BactQuant assay offers significantly broader coverage than a previously reported universal bacterial quantification assay BactQuant in vitro performance was better than the in silico predictions.},

 abstract = {Edible insects are often considered a healthier and more sustainable meat substitute and protein source. Many studies have examined factors affecting the consumption behavior towards edible insects among Western consumers. However, little is known about factors influencing consumer behavior towards edible insects in Asian countries even though Asians have a long history of consuming insects. In this study, we surveyed 614 Chinese consumers from Beijing and Nanjing to examine the factors influencing their consumption and purchase behavior of edible insects. We find that insect phobia, feelings of disgust, knowledge level, and social demographic factors such as age, household size, household income and region (Northern or Southern China) are the main factors influencing purchase decisions. In addition, the results indicate that the perceived positive attributes associated with edible insects, the preferences of children in the household, as well as age and knowledge level have positive impacts on consumption frequency. On the other hand, concerns of food safety and the shape of the insects have negative impacts on consumption frequency. Finally, the results suggest that educating consumers to increase knowledge of edible insects increases their probability to purchase insect foods. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.

 abstract = {Soy, milk and egg white proteins are commonly added to meat products. Proteins of non-meat origin, are applied to improve the water-binding capacity of meat and the texture of the product, as well as for economic reasons as meat substitutes. Detection of low amounts of these proteins is relevant to food safety and human health due to their high allergenicity. In this study, we demonstrate that a nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method can be used to reliably detect non-meat proteins derived from functional protein additives in various commercial poultry meat products (sausages, frankfurters, p{\^a}t{\'e}s). A large number of heat-stable peptide markers, unique to soy (43 peptides), milk (9 peptides) and egg white (12 peptides), were detected. The source of the peptides were main allergenic proteins, namely soy glycinin and \textgreek{b}-conglycinin, milk \textgreek{a}-S1-casein and the whey protein \textgreek{b}-lactoglobulin, as well as egg white ovotransferrin and lysozyme C. These proteins appeared to be relatively resistant to technological operations used in meat processing including roasting and sterilisation. The mass spectrometry method presented, enables reliable monitoring of the presence of allergenic proteins in severely processed meat products, providing a valuable alternative to PCR and ELISA tests. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Onwezen.2021,
 abstract = {Consumers' dietary patterns have a significant impact on planetary and personal health. To address health and environmental challenges one of the many possible solutions is to substitute meat consumption with alternative protein sources. This systematic review identifies 91 articles with a focus on the drivers of consumer acceptance of five alternative proteins: pulses, algae, insects, plant-based alternative proteins, and cultured meat. This review demonstrates that acceptance of the alternative proteins included here is relatively low (compared to that of meat); acceptance of insects is lowest, followed by acceptance of cultured meat. Pulses and plant-based alternative proteins have the highest acceptance level. In general, the following drivers of acceptance consistently show to be relevant for the acceptance of various alternative proteins: motives of taste and health, familiarity, attitudes, food neophobia, disgust, and social norms. However, there are also differences in relevance between individuals and between alternative proteins. For example, for insects and other novel alternative proteins the drivers of familiarity and affective processes of food neophobia and disgust seem more relevant. As part of gaining full insight in relevant drivers of acceptance, the review also shows an overview of the intervention studies that were included in the 91 articles of the review, providing implications on how consumer acceptance can be increased. The focal areas of the intervention studies included here do not fully correspond with the current knowledge of drivers. To date, intervention studies have mainly focussed on conscious deliberations, whereas familiarity and affective factors have also been shown to be key drivers. The comprehensive overview of the most relevant factors for consumer acceptance of various categories of alternative proteins thus shows large consistencies across bodies of research. Variations can be found in the nuances showing different priorities of drivers for different proteins and different segments, showing the relevance of being context and person specific for future research.},

 abstract = {Seafood comprising of both vertebrate and invertebrate aquatic organisms are nutritious, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, essential vitamins, proteins, minerals and form part of healthy diet. However, despite the health and nutritional benefits, seafood is highly perishable. Spoilage of seafood could be as a result of microbial activity, autolysis or chemical oxidation. Microbial activity constitutes more spoilage than others. Spoilage bacteria are commonly Gram negative and produce off odours and flavours in seafood as a result of their metabolic activities. Storage temperature, handling and packaging conditions affect microbial growth and thus the shelf-life of seafood. Due to the complexity of the microbial communities in seafood, culture dependent methods of detection may not be useful, hence the need for culture independent methods are necessary to understand the diversity of microbiota and spoilage process. Similarly, the volatile organic compounds released by spoilage bacteria are not fully understood in some seafood. This review therefore highlights current knowledge and understanding of seafood spoilage microbiota, volatile organic compounds, effects of storage temperature and packaging conditions on quality of seafood.},

PBMAs buyers tend to be young, single, female, college educated, employed, higher income, and non-white. About 20{\%} of consumers purchased a PBMA at least once, and 12{\%} purchased a PBMA on multiple occasions. About 2.79{\%} of households only purchased PBMAs. About 86{\%} of PBMA buyers also bought ground meat; however, PBMA buyers spent about 13{\%} less on ground meat. Interestingly, after a household's first PBMA purchase, ground meat consumption did not fall. The number of households buying a PBMA for the first time fell over the two year period studied, despite the increase in market share in the ground meat market.},

Critical choices loom as we ponder planet-friendly, plant-based diets to feed the global populace, while deciding whether meat consumption is still a viable option. Developments of meat substitutes are drawing investments, while commercialization of new protein sources moves ahead. Shifting from a primarily meat-based diet to a plant-based diet will require some consumers to adjust to different dietary habits and lifestyles. Intensification, yield enhancements, and improved seeds will be important agricultural factors to feed more people. Food start-ups disruptive ability will face off against conventional food manufacturers to decide the next frontier in product development. The human microbiome's effect on neural systems may identify approaches to influence changes to people's dietary habits. Individuals, organizations, and governments around the globe will need to resolve several policy issues and taking no action is not an option. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {High-moisture extrusion cooking (HMEC) is an efficient method for converting proteins and polysaccharides into fibrous structure that is used in the industrial production of meat analogs. The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate current knowledge regarding the modification of protein structure including denaturation and reassembly upon extrusion processing and to correlate this understanding to the structure of the final products. Although there is no consensus on the relative importance of a certain type of bond on extrudates' structure, literature suggests that, regardless of moisture level, these linkages and interactions give rise to distinctive hierarchical order. Both noncovalent and disulfide bonds contribute to the extrudates' fibrous structure. At high water levels, hydrogen and disulfide bonds play a dominant role in extrudates' texture. The process parameters including cooking temperature, screw speed, and moisture content have significant albeit different levels of impact on the texturization process. Their correlation with the ingredients' physiochemical properties provides a greater insight into the process-structure-function relationship of meat analogs. The tendency of protein and polysaccharide blends to phase separate rather than produce a homogeneous mix is a particularly important aspect that leads to the formation of fibrous layers when extruded. This review shows that systematic studies are required to measure and explain synergistic and competitive interactions between proteins and other ingredients such as carbohydrates with a focus on their incompatibility. The wide range of plant protein source can be utilized in the HMEC process to produce texturized products, including meat analogs.},

Unfortunately, it has been reported that many foodborne pathogens can be induced to enter the VBNC state by the limiting environmental conditions during food processing and preservation, such as extreme temperatures, drying, irradiation, pulsed electric field, and high pressure stress, as well as the addition of preservatives and disinfectants. After entering the VBNC state, foodborne pathogens will introduce a serious crisis to food safety and public health because they cannot be detected using conventional plate counting techniques. This review provides an overview of the various features of the VBNC state, including the biological characteristics, induction and resuscitation factors, formation and resuscitation mechanisms, detection methods, and relationship to food safety.},

A multiscale method combined with some emerging techniques such as atomic force microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy and X-ray microscopy was used to make the whole extrusion process visible to show the process of forming a meat-like fibrous structure using two-dimensional and three-dimensional perspectives. The results showed that the protein molecules underwent dramatic structural changes and unfolded in the extruder barrel, which created favorable conditions for molecular rearrangement in the subsequent zones. It was confirmed that the meat-like fibrous structure started to form at the junction of the die and the cooling zone and that this structure was caused by the phase separation and rearrangement of protein molecules in the cooling zone. Moreover, the interactions between hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds formed in the cooling zone maintained the meat-like fibrous structure with an \textgreek{a}-helix {\textgreater} \textgreek{b}-sheet {\textgreater} \textgreek{b}-turn {\textgreater} random coil. Of the two main peanut proteins, arachin played a greater role in forming the fibrous structure than conarachin, especially those subunits of arachin with a molecular weight of 42, 39, and 22 kDa.},

However, the numbers, diversity and plant-specific adaptions of LAB found on plant tissues prior to the start of those fermentations are not well understood. When measured, these bacteria have been recovered from the aerial surfaces of plants in a range from {\textless}10 CFU g-1 to over 108.5 CFU g-1 of plant tissue and in lower quantities from the soil and rhizosphere. Plant-associated LAB include well-known generalist taxa such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which are essential for numerous food and beverage fermentations. Other plant-associated LAB encompass specialist taxa such as Lactobacillus florum and Fructobacillus, many of which were discovered relatively recently and their significance on plants and in foods is not yet recognized. LAB recovered from plants possess the capacity to consume plant sugars, detoxify phenolic compounds and tolerate the numerous biotic and abiotic stresses common to plant surfaces. Although most generalist and some specialist LAB grow rapidly in food and beverages fermentations and can cause spoilage of fresh and fermented fruits and vegetables, the importance of living plants as habitats for these bacteria and LAB contributions to plant microbiomes remain to be shown.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

World Health Organization has estimated that 1 in 10 people fall ill and 4, 20, 000 die every year from eating contaminated food. Food pathogens like Escherichia, Salmonella, Staphylococcus and Listeria pose a serious threat to human health.

OBJECTIVE

The objective was to isolate microbes from meat stored at refrigerated conditions and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the cell-free supernatant against food pathogens.

METHODS

Chicken and Pork samples were procured and stored at refrigerated conditions (4-7ºC) for 2 weeks. The samples were plated on to Nutrient agar (NA) and De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar for isolation of aerobic and lactic acid bacteria. Cell-free supernatants of the isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus by microtiter plate assay. The 5 most - effective strains were screened for hemolytic activity and identified by 16s rRNA sequencing.

RESULTS

A total of 110 strains were isolated, out of which the top 5 most - effective strains were all from MRS agar. They showed 88-90{\%} inhibition against E. coli and S. typhimurium, whereas 60 to 70 {\%} against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes. These strains were found to be non - hemolytic and were identified as Leuconostoc spp. namely, L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides J18, CP003101; L. mesenteroides LM2; L. mesenteroides ATCC 8293, CP000414; L. gelidum subsp. gasicomitatum LM G 18811 and L. mesenteroides; LM2, AY675249.

CONCLUSION

Leuconostoc are known to be effective in controlling foodborne pathogens and therefore, these strains have the potential for application in food and human.},

 abstract = {Food additives and colorants are extensively used in the food industry to improve food quality and safety during processing, storage and packing. Sourcing of these molecules is predominately through three means: extraction from natural sources, chemical synthesis, and bio-production, with the first two being the most utilized. However, growing demands for sustainability, safety and ``natural'' products have renewed interest in using bio-based production methods. Likewise, the move to more cultured foods and meat alternatives requires the production of new additives and colorants. The production of bio-based food additives and colorants is an interdisciplinary research endeavor and represents a growing trend in future food. To highlight the potential of microbial hosts for food additive and colorant production, we focus on current advances for example molecules based on their utilization stage and bio-production yield as follows: (I) approved and industrially produced with high titers; (II) approved and produced with decent titers (in the g/L range), but requiring further engineering to reduce production costs; (III) approved and produced with very early stage titers (in the mg/L range); and (IV) new/potential candidates that have not been approved but can be sourced through microbes. Promising approaches, as well as current challenges and future directions will also be thoroughly discussed for the bioproduction of these food additives and colorants. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large.

Large-scale cell culture for clean meat production presents a number of unique requirements that are not currently met by existing products and processes from the biomedical industry $-$ most notably related to cost constraints and scale requirements. Developing these tools for clean meat would simultaneously advance the technology and reduce costs for biomedical and therapeutic applications.

Most of these organisms are non-pathogenic to immunocompetent hosts; in fact, many are beneficial, supplying vitamins for host nutrition and filling the available microbiological niche to limit access and consequent pathology when pathogens are encountered. Thus, mammalian health depends on mutualism between host and flora. This is evident in inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, where aberrant responses to microbiota can result in host pathology. Studies with axenic (germ-free) or deliberately colonised animals have revealed that commensal organisms are required for the development of a fully functional immune system and affect many physiological processes within the host. Here, we describe the technical requirements for raising and maintaining axenic and gnotobiotic animals, and highlight the extreme diversity of changes within and beyond the immune system that occur when a germ-free animal is colonized with commensal bacteria.},

Rising incomes and urbanization are driving a global dietary transition in which traditional diets are replaced by diets higher in refined sugars, refined fats, oils and meats. By 2050 these dietary trends, if unchecked, would be a major contributor to an estimated 80 per cent increase in global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from food production and to global land clearing. Moreover, these dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of type II diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies. Alternative diets that offer substantial health benefits could, if widely adopted, reduce global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land clearing and resultant species extinctions, and help prevent such diet-related chronic non-communicable diseases. The implementation of dietary solutions to the tightly linked diet-environment-health trilemma is a global challenge, and opportunity, of great environmental and public health importance.},

 abstract = {Eating less meat is increasingly seen as a healthier, more ethical option. This is leading to growing numbers of flexitarian consumers looking for plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) to replace at least some of the animal meat they consume. Popular PBMA products amongst flexitarians, including plant-based mince, burgers, sausages and meatballs, are often perceived as low-quality, ultra-processed foods. However, we argue that the mere industrial processing of ingredients of plant origin does not make a PBMA product ultra-processed by default. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to assess the changes to the gut microbiota of a group of 20 participants who replaced several meat-containing meals per week with meals cooked with PBMA products and compared these changes to those experienced by a size-matched control. Stool samples were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. The resulting raw data was analysed in a compositionality-aware manner, using a range of innovative bioinformatic methods. Noteworthy changes included an increase in butyrate metabolising potential-chiefly in the 4-aminobutyrate/succinate and glutarate pathways-and in the joint abundance of butyrate-producing taxa in the intervention group compared to control. We also observed a decrease in the Tenericutes phylum in the intervention group and an increase in the control group. Based on our findings, we concluded that the occasional replacement of animal meat with PBMA products seen in flexitarian dietary patterns can promote positive changes in the gut microbiome of consumers.},

 abstract = {The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, a na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifier, can rapidly and accurately classify bacterial 16S rRNA sequences into the new higher-order taxonomy proposed in Bergey's Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (2nd ed., release 5.0, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, 2004). It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98{\%}) were of high estimated confidence ({\textgreater} or = 95{\%}) and high accuracy (98{\%}). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89{\%} or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.},

 abstract = {Background: Plant-based meat analogues (PBMA) are promising to address the issue of imbalance between global meat supply and demand. PBMA can contribute to an environmentally friendly and sustainable food production. As one of the main raw materials in PBMA, the naturally occurring beany flavor in soybean restricts their further development and consumer acceptance. To enhance the application of soybean as an ingredient in PBMA as well as improve consumer acceptability, the beany flavor should be effectively eliminated. Scope and approach: In the present review, the main beany flavor compounds, their formation mechanism, the interaction between soybean protein and off-flavor compounds, the detection methods, and the removal methods were systematically reviewed. Notably, the main removal approaches for beany flavor of soybean can be divided into three categories, namely biotechnological, physical and chemical methods. The different removal methods of beany flavor in soybean protein were compared and discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Application of biotechnological methods to eliminate beany flavor in soybean is challenging. Although enzymatic method is safe and clean, its catalytic efficiency is relatively low. Chemical modification methods possess food safety threats. By contrast, physical processing is relatively effective in removing beany flavor, while heating may exert a negative impact on the functional properties of soybean protein. Collectively, enzymatic modification combined with novel non-thermal processing as well as the optimized texturization process of soybean protein is of great significance to elimination of beany flavor in PBMA. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT

Contamination of beer arises in 50{\%} of all events at the late stages of production, in the filling area. This is where biofilms, a consortia of microorganisms embedded in a matrix composed of extracellular polymeric substances, play a critical role. To date, most studies have focused on the presence of (biofilm-forming) microorganisms in the filling environment. Our aim was to characterize the microbial status as well as the presence of possible biofilms at a can filling line for beer by determining the presence of microorganisms and their associated matrix components (carbohydrates, proteins and extracellular DNA [eDNA]). For 23 sampling sites, targeted quantitative PCR confirmed the presence of microorganisms at 10 sites during operation and at 3 sites after cleaning. The evaluation of carbohydrates, eDNA, and proteins showed that 16 sites were positive for at least one component during operation and 4 after cleaning. We identified one potential biofilm hotspot, namely the struts below the filler, harboring high loads of bacteria and yeast, eDNA, carbohydrates, and proteins. The protein pattern was different from that of beer. This work deepens our understanding of biofilms and microorganisms found at the filling line of beer beverages at sites critical for production.

 abstract = {Biofilms are comprised of microorganisms embedded in a self-produced matrix that normally adhere to a surface. In the food processing environment they are suggested to be a source of contamination leading to food spoilage or the transmission of food-borne pathogens. To date, research has mainly focused on the presence of (biofilm-forming) bacteria within food processing environments, without measuring the associated biofilm matrix components. Here, we assessed the presence of biofilms within a meat processing environment, processing pork, poultry and beef, by the detection of microorganisms and at least two biofilm matrix components. Sampling included 47 food contact surfaces and 61 non-food contact surfaces from eleven rooms within an Austrian meat processing plant, either during operation or after cleaning and disinfection. The 108 samples were analysed for the presence of microorganisms by cultivation and targeted quantitative real-time PCR based on 16S rRNA. Furthermore, the presence of the major matrix components carbohydrates, extracellular DNA and proteins was evaluated. Overall, we identified ten biofilm hotspots, among them seven of which were sampled during operation and three after cleaning and disinfection. Five biofilms were detected on food contact surfaces (cutters and associated equipment and a screw conveyor) and five on non-food contact surfaces (drains and water hoses) resulting in 9.3 {\%} of the sites being classified as biofilm positive. From these biofilm positive samples, we cultivated bacteria of 29 different genera. The most prevalent bacteria belonged to the genera Brochothrix (present in 80 {\%} of biofilms), Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter (isolated from 70 {\%} biofilms). From each biofilm we isolated bacteria from four to twelve different genera, indicating the presence of multi-species biofilms. This work ultimately determined the presence of multi-species biofilms within the meat processing environment, thereby identifying various sources of potential contamination. Especially the identification of biofilms in water hoses and associated parts highlights the need of a frequent monitoring at these sites. The knowledge gained about the presence and composition of biofilms (i.e. chemical and microbiological) will help to prevent and reduce biofilm formation within food processing environments.},

In recent years, however, this has begun to change. Cultivation-independent studies have revealed that a few bacterial phyla predominate in the phyllosphere of different plants and that plant factors are involved in shaping these phyllosphere communities, which feature specific adaptations and exhibit multipartite relationships both with host plants and among community members. Insights into the underlying structural principles of indigenous microbial phyllosphere populations will help us to develop a deeper understanding of the phyllosphere microbiota and will have applications in the promotion of plant growth and plant protection.},

Examples of insect consumption are given from the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Nigeria. It is argued that edible insects may qualify as a product with both an ecolabel and an animal welfare label. Concerning their nutritional value, it is difficult to generalize with the more than 2000 insect species eaten, but proteins, fatty acids, and micronutrients are discussed. The main food safety risk of edible insects relates to contamination, in particular when insects are reared on organic side streams. The best strategies to promote insect consumption are: to give people a tasting experience and to incorporate the insects unrecognizably into familiar products. Considering the recent interest worldwide by the academic world and private enterprise in insects as food and feed, it has the potential to become an important sector in the food and agriculture industry. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the presence of B12 in a cultivated strain of an aquatic plant: Wolffia globosa (Mankai), and predicted functional pathways using gut-bioreactor, and the effects of long-term Mankai consumption as a partial meat substitute, on serum B12 concentrations. Methods: We used microbiological assay, liquid-chromatography/electrospray-ionization-tandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and anoxic bioreactors for the B12 experiments. We explored the effect of a green Mediterranean/low-meat diet, containing 100 g of frozen Mankai shake/day, on serum B12 levels during the 18-month DIRECT-PLUS (ID:NCT03020186) weight-loss trial, compared with control and Mediterranean diet groups. Results: The B12 content of Mankai was consistent at different seasons (p = 0.76). Several cobalamin congeners (Hydroxocobalamin(OH-B12 ); 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin(Ado-B12 ); methylcobalamin(Me-B12 ); cyanocobalamin(CN-B12 )) were identified in Mankai extracts, whereas no pseudo B12 was detected. A higher abundance of 16S-rRNA gene amplicon sequences associated with a genome containing a KEGG ortholog involved in microbial B12 metabolism were observed, compared with control bioreactors that lacked Mankai. Following the DIRECT-PLUS intervention (n = 294 participants; retention-rate = 89{\%}; baseline B12 = 420.5 $\pm$ 187.8 pg/mL), serum B12 increased by 5.2{\%} in control, 9.9{\%} in Mediterranean, and 15.4{\%} in Mankai-containing green Mediterranean/low-meat diets (p = 0.025 between extreme groups).

 abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away.

Despite biotechnology advancements, meat-based foods are still under scrutiny because of the presence of pathogens, which causes a loss of consumer confidence and consequently a fall in demand. In this context, Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) as GRAS organisms offer an alternative for developing pathogen-free foods, particularly avoiding Listeria monocytogenes, with minimal processing and fewer additives while maintaining the foods' sensorial characteristics. The use of LAB strains, enabling us to produce antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) in addition to lactic acid, with an impact on quality and safety during fermentation, processing, and/or storage of meat and ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products, constitutes a promising tool. A number of bacteriocin-based strategies including the use of bioprotective cultures, purified and/or semi-purified bacteriocins as well as their inclusion in varied packaging materials under different storage conditions, have been investigated. The application of bacteriocins as part of hurdle technology using non-thermal technologies was explored for the preservation of RTE meat products. Likewise, considering that food contamination with L. monocytogenes is a consequence of the post-processing manipulation of RTE foods, the role of bacteriocinogenic LAB in the control of biofilms formed on industrial surfaces is also discussed.},

The spoilage can derive from microbial development and consumption of meat nutrients by bacteria with a consequent release of undesired metabolites. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are generated during meat storage can have an olfactory impact and can lead to rejection of the product when their concentration increase significantly as a result of microbial development. The VOCs most commonly identified in meat during storage include alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, esters and sulfur compounds. In this review, the VOCs found in fresh meat during storage in specific conditions are described together with the possible bacterial populations responsible of their production. In addition, on the basis of the data available in the literature, the sensory impact of the VOCs and their dynamics during storage is discussed to highlight their possible contribution to the spoilage of meat.},

@article{Chan.2011,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The evidence that red and processed meat influences colorectal carcinogenesis was judged convincing in the 2007 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research report. Since then, ten prospective studies have published new results. Here we update the evidence from prospective studies and explore whether there is a non-linear association of red and processed meats with colorectal cancer risk.

METHODS AND FINDINGS

Relevant prospective studies were identified in PubMed until March 2011. For each study, relative risks and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled with a random-effects model, weighting for the inverse of the variance, in highest versus lowest intake comparison, and dose-response meta-analyses. Red and processed meats intake was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk. The summary relative risk (RR) of colorectal cancer for the highest versus the lowest intake was 1.22 (95{\%} CI  =  1.11-1.34) and the RR for every 100 g/day increase was 1.14 (95{\%} CI  =  1.04-1.24). Non-linear dose-response meta-analyses revealed that colorectal cancer risk increases approximately linearly with increasing intake of red and processed meats up to approximately 140 g/day, where the curve approaches its plateau. The associations were similar for colon and rectal cancer risk. When analyzed separately, colorectal cancer risk was related to intake of fresh red meat (RR(for 100 g/day increase)  =  1.17, 95{\%} CI  =  1.05-1.31) and processed meat (RR (for 50 g/day increase)  =  1.18, 95{\%} CI  =  1.10-1.28). Similar results were observed for colon cancer, but for rectal cancer, no significant associations were observed.

CONCLUSIONS

High intake of red and processed meat is associated with significant increased risk of colorectal, colon and rectal cancers. The overall evidence of prospective studies supports limiting red and processed meat consumption as one of the dietary recommendations for the prevention of colorectal cancer.},

 abstract = {Vegetarianism, which is increasingly widespread in Western societies, is underpinned by various motivations (ethical, environmental, health concerns $\ldots$) and the question of its association with eating disorders continues to divide the literature. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore and compare eating motives/attitudes and bodily preoccupations of vegetarian and omnivorous participants from the general population. Forty-nine vegetarians and 52 omnivores, aged between 18 and 70 years, completed a battery of questionnaires including sociodemographic characteristics, Body Mass Indexes (BMI - current, ideal, lifetime lowest, and lifetime highest), the Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ), the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), and the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Compared to omnivores, vegetarians reported lower current (p~=~.017), ideal (p~=~.009), and lifetime lowest (p~=~.005) BMIs, more motivations related to health (p~=~.001) and natural content (p~{\textless}~.0001), but less weight control motivations (p~=~.015). While no differences were observed in EAT-26 scores, vegetarians had lower BSQ total scores (p~=~.043), and lower scores on the Body Dissatisfaction related to Lower body parts (p~=~.025) and Unsuited Cognitions and Behaviors (p~=~.015) subscales compared to omnivores. Separate gender comparisons revealed that these differences existed only among women. Hierarchical regressions revealed that the natural content motivation was the strongest positive statistical predictor of the vegetarian group (Exp\textgreek{b}~=~1.18, p~=~.002), while the weight control motivation was a negative statistical predictor (Exp\textgreek{b}~=~.710, p~=~.023). Results demonstrated that vegetarians expressed motivation for a healthy and natural diet, and were less concerned about controlling their weight than the omnivores. Vegetarian women had lower BMIs but expressed fewer psychological concerns associated with eating disorders than omnivorous women. Vegetarian diets appeared to be associated with health benefits and less body and weight concerns, particularly among women in the general population.},

 abstract = {The viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state has been recognized as a strategy for bacteria to cope with stressful environments; in this state, bacteria fail to grow on routine culture medium but are actually alive and can resuscitate into a culturable state under favorable conditions. The VBNC state may pose a great threat to food safety and public health. To date, more than 100 VBNC microorganism species have been proven to exist in fields of food safety, environmental application, and agricultural diseases. Most harsh conditions can induce these microorganisms into the VBNC state, including food processing and preservation methods, adverse environmental conditions, and plant-disease controlling means. The characteristics of VBNC state cells differ from those of normally growing cells and dead cells, based on which of the various detection methods are developed, and they are of great significance for potential risk assessment. To provide molecular level insights into this state, many studies on induction and resuscitation mechanisms have emerged over the past three decades, including research on omics, specific genes, or proteins involved in VBNC state formation and the roles of promoters in resuscitation from the VBNC state. In this review, microorganism species, induction and resuscitation factors, detection methods, and formation and resuscitation mechanisms of the VBNC state are comprehensively and systematically summarized.},

 abstract = {Aerial plant surfaces represent the largest biological interface on Earth and provide essential services as sites of carbon dioxide fixation, molecular oxygen release, and primary biomass production. Rather than existing as axenic organisms, plants are colonized by microorganisms that affect both their health and growth. To gain insight into the physiology of phyllosphere bacteria under in situ conditions, we performed a culture-independent analysis of the microbiota associated with leaves of soybean, clover, and Arabidopsis thaliana plants using a metaproteogenomic approach. We found a high consistency of the communities on the 3 different plant species, both with respect to the predominant community members (including the alphaproteobacterial genera Sphingomonas and Methylo bacterium) and with respect to their proteomes. Observed known proteins of Methylobacterium were to a large extent related to the ability of these bacteria to use methanol as a source of carbon and energy. A remarkably high expression of various TonB-dependent receptors was observed for Sphingomonas. Because these outer membrane proteins are involved in transport processes of various carbohydrates, a particularly large substrate utilization pattern for Sphingomonads can be assumed to occur in the phyllosphere. These adaptations at the genus level can be expected to contribute to the success and coexistence of these 2 taxa on plant leaves. We anticipate that our results will form the basis for the identification of unique traits of phyllosphere bacteria, and for uncovering previously unrecorded mechanisms of bacteria-plant and bacteria-bacteria relationships.},

Relatedness analysis of 17 Leu. mesenteroides strains available in GenBank based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, average nucleotide identity, in silico DNA-DNA hybridization, molecular phenotype, and core-genome indicated that Leu. mesenteroides has been separated into different phylogenetic lineages. Pan-genome of Leu. mesenteroides strains, consisting of 999 genes in core-genome, 1,432 genes in accessory-genome, and 754 genes in unique genome, and their COG and KEGG analyses showed that Leu. mesenteroides harbors strain-specifically diverse metabolisms, probably representing high evolutionary genome changes. The reconstruction of fermentative metabolic pathways for Leu. mesenteroides strains showed that Leu. mesenteroides produces various metabolites such as lactate, ethanol, acetate, CO2, mannitol, diacetyl, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol through an obligate heterolactic fermentation from various carbohydrates. Fermentative metabolic features of Leu. mesenteroides during kimchi fermentation were investigated through transcriptional analyses for the KEGG pathways and reconstructed metabolic pathways of Leu. mesenteroides using kimchi metatranscriptomic data. This was the first study to investigate the genomic and metabolic features of Leu. mesenteroides through pan-genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, and may provide insights into its genomic and metabolic features and a better understanding of kimchi fermentations by Leu. mesenteroides.},

This study aimed to profile and compare plant-based meat substitutes (mimicking meat) with equivalent meat products, and 2015 data. An audit undertaken in May (updated in September 2019) from four metropolitan Sydney supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, IGA), collected nutrition information and Health Star Rating (HSR) from 137 products (50 burgers, 10 mince, 29 sausages, 24 chicken, 9 seafood, 15 other). Mean ($\pm$ standard deviation (SD)) and median (range) was calculated for nutrients and HSR. Plant-based options were generally lower in kilojoules, total and saturated fat, higher in carbohydrate, sugars, and dietary fibre compared with meat. Only 4{\%} of products were low in sodium (58-1200 mg/100 g). Less than a quarter of products (24{\%}) were fortified with vitamin B12, 20{\%} with iron, and 18{\%} with zinc. HSR featured on 46{\%} (3.6-4.4 stars). On-pack claims were vegetarian/vegan/plant-based (80{\%}), protein (63{\%}), non-genetically modified/organic (34{\%}), gluten free (28{\%}). Product numbers increased five-fold ($\uparrow$429{\%}) in four years. The plant protein trend has prompted innovation in meat substitutes, however wide nutrient ranges and higher sodium levels highlights the importance of nutrition guidelines in their development to ensure equivalence with animal-based proteins.},

@article{Crimarco.2020,
 abstract = {Background: Despite the rising popularity of plant-based alternative meats, there is limited evidence of the health effects of these products. Objectives: We aimed to compare the effect of consuming plant-based alternative meat (Plant) as opposed to animal meat (Animal) on health factors. The primary outcome was fasting serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Secondary outcomes included fasting insulin-like growth factor 1, lipids, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and weight. Methods: SWAP-MEAT (The Study With Appetizing Plantfood - Meat Eating Alternatives Trial) was a single-site, randomized crossover trial with no washout period. Participants received Plant and Animal products, dietary counseling, lab assessments, microbiome assessments (16S), and anthropometric measurements. Participants were instructed to consume $\geq$2 servings/d of Plant compared with Animal for 8 wk each, while keeping all other foods and beverages as similar as possible between the 2 phases. Results: The 36 participants who provided complete data for both crossover phases included 67{\%} women, were 69{\%} Caucasian, had a mean $\pm$ SD age 50 $\pm$ 14 y, and BMI 28 $\pm$ 5 kg/m2. Mean $\pm$ SD servings per day were not different by intervention sequence: 2.5 $\pm$ 0.6 compared with 2.6 $\pm$ 0.7 for Plant and Animal, respectively (P = 0.76). Mean $\pm$ SEM TMAO concentrations were significantly lower overall for Plant (2.7 $\pm$ 0.3) than for Animal (4.7 $\pm$ 0.9) (P = 0.012), but a significant order effect was observed (P = 0.023). TMAO concentrations were significantly lower for Plant among the n = 18 who received Plant second (2.9 $\pm$ 0.4 compared with 6.4 $\pm$ 1.5, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.007), but not for the n = 18 who received Plant first (2.5 $\pm$ 0.4 compared with 3.0 $\pm$ 0.6, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.23). Exploratory analyses of the microbiome failed to reveal possible responder compared with nonresponder factors. Mean $\pm$ SEM LDL-cholesterol concentrations (109.9 $\pm$ 4.5 compared with 120.7 $\pm$ 4.5 mg/dL, P = 0.002) and weight (78.7 $\pm$ 3.0 compared with 79.6 $\pm$ 3.0 kg, P {\textless} 0.001) were lower during the Plant phase. Conclusions: Among generally healthy adults, contrasting Plant with Animal intake, while keeping all other dietary components similar, the Plant products improved several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including TMAO; there were no adverse effects on risk factors from the Plant products.

@article{Comi.2012,
 abstract = {Summary Two types of spoilage in cooked hams were investigated. One was a result of the growth of Weissella viridescens, which produces cavities in the muscles of hams after cooking. The origin of W.~viridescens was shown to be the brine used in the preparation of the ham. After its production, the brine is usually left at room temperature for several hours before being cooled and used, allowing the growth of the microorganism. The second types of spoilage is because of Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc carnosum, which grew during the 4--6 °C storage period of cooked hams packaged under vacuum. The spoilage consisted of the production of various molecules such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols, esters and sulphur compounds. Oxidative and auto-oxidative phenomena also occurred during spoilage.},

 abstract = {Cooked bacon is a typical Italian meat product. After production, cooked bacon is stored at 4~$\pm$~2~°C. During storage, the microorganisms that survived pasteurisation can grow and produce spoilage. For the first time, we studied the cause of the deterioration in spoiled cooked bacon compared to unspoiled samples. Moreover, the use of bio-protective cultures to improve the quality of the product and eliminate the risk of spoilage was tested. The results show that Leuconostoc mesenteroides is responsible for spoilage and produces a greening colour of the meat, slime and various compounds that result from the fermentation of sugars and the degradation of nitrogen compounds. Finally, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis and Lactobacillus sakei were able to reduce the risk of Leuconostoc mesenteroides spoilage.},

@article{Bryant.2020,
 abstract = {The negative impacts of meat consumption for animals, the environment, and human health are more pressing than ever. Although some evidence points to an ongoing reduction in meat consumption in Europe, consumers are overall unwilling to cut their meat consumption in a substantial way. The present study investigates dietary identities and perceptions of cultured meat in nationally representative samples from Germany (n = 1000) and France (n = 1000). Participants were recruited through an Ipsos panel to answer an online survey, which included questions about their current and intended consumption of conventional meat, as well as questions about their opinions of cultured meat. We find that, whilst rates of vegetarianism were relatively low in France, unrestricted meat-eaters were a minority in Germany, and concern for animal welfare was the most common reason given for meat reduction. Substantial markets for cultured meat exist in both countries, although German consumers are significantly more open to the concept than the French. Strikingly, cultured meat acceptance is significantly higher amongst agricultural and meat workers, indicating that those who are closest to existing meat production methods are most likely to prefer alternatives. We found some evidence that pro-cultured meat messages, which focus on antibiotic resistance and food safety, are significantly more persuasive than those that focus on animals or the environment. Furthermore, consumers project that they would be significantly more likely to consume cultured meat that does not contain genetically modified ingredients. Overall, we find substantially large markets for cultured meat in Germany and France, and identify some potential ways to further increase acceptance in these markets. We conclude by highlighting the most promising markets for cultured meat, and highlighting a lack of antibiotics as a potentially persuasive message about cultured meat. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.

@article{BenHarb.2019,
 abstract = {In order to encourage Western populations to increase their consumption of vegetables, we suggest turning legumes into novel, healthy foods by applying an old, previously widespread method of food preservation: fermentation. In the present study, a total of 55 strains from different microbial species (isolated from cheese or plants) were investigated for their ability to: (i) grow on a emulsion containing 100{\%} pea proteins and no carbohydrates or on a 50:50 pea:milk protein emulsion containing lactose, (ii) increase aroma quality and reduce sensory off-flavors; and (iii) compete against endogenous micro organisms. The presence of carbohydrates in the mixed pea:milk emulsion markedly influenced the fermentation by strongly reducing the pH through lactic fermentation, whereas the absence of carbohydrates in the pea emulsion promoted alkaline or neutral fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria assigned to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus casei species grew well in both the pea and pea:milk emulsions. Most of the fungal strains tested (particularly those belonging to the Mucor and Geotrichum genera) were also able to grow on both emulsions. Although most Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria did not compete with endogenous microbiota (Bacillus), some species such as Hafnia alvei, Acinetobacter johnsonii and Glutamicibacter arilaitensis grew strongly and appeared to restrict the development of the endogenous microbiota when the pea emulsion was inoculated with a combination of three to nine strains. In the mixed emulsions, lactic fermentation inhibited Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (e.g. Brevibacterium casei, Corynebacterium casei, Staphylococcus lentus) to the greatest extent but also inhibited Bacillus (e.g. Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis). Overall, this procedure enabled us to select two microbial consortia able to colonize pea-based products and positively influence the release of volatile compounds by generating a roasted/grilled aroma for the 100{\%} pea emulsion, and a fruity, lactic aroma for the 50:50 pea:milk emulsion. Moreover, the fermentation in the pea-based emulsions reduced the level of hexanal, which otherwise leads to an undesired green pea aroma. Our present results show how the assembly of multiple microbial cultures can help to develop an innovative food product.},

@article{Beniwal.2021,
 abstract = {Increasing awareness of inefficient meat production and its future impact on global food security has led the food industry to look for a sustainable approach. Meat products have superior sensorial perception, because of their molecular composition and fibrous structure. Current understanding in the science of food structuring has enabled the utilization of alternative or nonmeat protein ingredients to create novel structured matrices that could resemble the textural functionality of real meat. The physicochemical and structural changes that occur in concentrated protein systems during thermomechanical processing lead to the creation of a fibrous or layered meat-like texture. Phase transitions in concentrated protein systems during protein-protein, protein-polysaccharide, protein-lipid, and protein-water interactions significantly influence the texture and the overall sensory quality of meat analogs. This review summarizes the roles of raw materials (moisture, protein type and concentration, lipids, polysaccharides, and air) and processing parameters (temperature, pH, and shear) in modulating the behavior of the protein phase during the restructuring process (structure-function-process relationship). The big challenge for the food industry is to manufacture concept-based (such as beef-like, chicken-like, etc.) meat analogs with controlled structural attributes. This information will be useful in developing superior meat analogs that fulfill consumer expectations when replacing meat in their diet.},

 abstract = {Consumer interest in protein rich diets is increasing, with more attention being paid to the protein source. Despite the occurrence of animal proteins in the human diet, non-animal proteins are gaining popularity around the world due to their health benefits, environmental sustainability, and ethical merit. These sources of protein qualify for vegan, vegetarian, and flexitarian diets. Non-animal proteins are versatile, derived mainly from cereals, vegetables, pulses, algae (seaweed and microalgae), fungi, and bacteria. This review's intent is to analyze the current and future direction of research and innovation in non-animal proteins, and to elucidate the extent (limitations and opportunities) of their applications in food and beverage industries. Prior knowledge provided relevant information on protein features (processing, structure, and techno-functionality) with particular focus on those derived from soy and wheat. In the current food landscape, beyond conventionally used plant sources, other plant proteins are gaining traction as alternative ingredients to formulate animal-free foodstuffs (e.g., meat alternatives, beverages, baked products, snack foods, and others). Microbial proteins derived from fungi and algae are also food ingredients of interest due to their high protein quantity and quality, however there is no commercial food application for bacterial protein yet. In the future, key points to consider are the importance of strain/variety selection, advances in extraction technologies, toxicity assessment, and how this source can be used to create food products for personalized nutrition. {\copyright} 2021 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Taxonomic classification of marker-gene sequences is an important step in microbiome analysis.

RESULTS

We present q2-feature-classifier ( https://github.com/qiime2/q2-feature-classifier ), a QIIME 2 plugin containing several novel machine-learning and alignment-based methods for taxonomy classification. We evaluated and optimized several commonly used classification methods implemented in QIIME 1 (RDP, BLAST, UCLUST, and SortMeRNA) and several new methods implemented in QIIME 2 (a scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier, and alignment-based taxonomy consensus methods based on VSEARCH, and BLAST+) for classification of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker-gene amplicon sequence data. The naive-Bayes, BLAST+-based, and VSEARCH-based classifiers implemented in QIIME 2 meet or exceed the species-level accuracy of other commonly used methods designed for classification of marker gene sequences that were evaluated in this work. These evaluations, based on 19 mock communities and error-free sequence simulations, including classification of simulated {\textquotedbl}novel{\textquotedbl} marker-gene sequences, are available in our extensible benchmarking framework, tax-credit ( https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit-data ).

CONCLUSIONS

Our results illustrate the importance of parameter tuning for optimizing classifier performance, and we make recommendations regarding parameter choices for these classifiers under a range of standard operating conditions. q2-feature-classifier and tax-credit are both free, open-source, BSD-licensed packages available on GitHub.},

@article{Boer.2020,
 abstract = {Fish has several benefits that make it a desirable part of a healthy diet. It is also a high-protein product that can be used as a relatively efficient meat replacer. Both from a health and sustainability perspective, however, it is important to consider the optimum number of fish servings per week and to examine whether fish and plant protein can be brought under the same heading of alternative protein sources. To explore the consumer perspective on these issues, this paper draws on a brief literature study and a re-analysis of survey data from the Netherlands collected earlier. The hypothesis was that affinities with fish consumption and plant-based protein sources are to a certain extent related to each other, based on common relationships with food involvement, which set them apart from meat. The results showed that the hypothesis needed to be nuanced: fish consumption was associated exclusively with affinity with spicy meals based on authentic plant protein sources (e.g. nuts) and this relationship was partially based on food involvement. The results are in line with current Dutch recommendations that encourage consumers to eat one serving of fish per week and that stimulate those who already eat more than one serving of fish to replace the rest by plant-based protein sources. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Diverse communities of bacteria inhabit plant leaves and roots and those bacteria play a crucial role for plant health and growth. Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model to study plant pathogen interactions, but little is known about its associated bacterial community under natural conditions. We used 454 pyrosequencing to characterize the bacterial communities associated with the roots and the leaves of wild A. thaliana collected at 4 sites; we further compared communities on the outside of the plants with communities in the endophytic compartments. We found that the most heavily sequenced bacteria in A. thaliana associated community are related to culturable species. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes are the most abundant phyla in both leaf and root samples. At the genus level, sequences of Massilia and Flavobacterium are prevalent in both samples. Organ (leaf vs root) and habitat (epiphytes vs endophytes) structure the community. In the roots, richness is higher in the epiphytic communities compared to the endophytic compartment (P = 0.024), while the reverse is true for the leaves (P = 0.032). Interestingly, leaf and root endophytic compartments do not differ in richness, diversity and evenness, while they differ in community composition (P = 0.001). The results show that although the communities associated with leaves and roots share many bacterial species, the associated communities differ in structure.},

 abstract = {Introduction Reducing meat consumption could contribute towards preventing some chronic conditions and protecting the natural environment. This study will examine the effectiveness of a behavioural intervention to reduce meat consumption. Methods and analyses Replacing meat with alternative plant-based product is a randomised controlled trial comparing a behavioural intervention to reduce meat consumption with a no intervention control condition. Eligible volunteers will be recruited from the general public through advertisement and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive no intervention or a 4-week intervention comprising the provision of free plant-based meat alternatives, written information on the health and environmental benefits of eating less meat, success stories of people who reduced their meat consumption and recipes. The primary outcome is the change in meat consumption at 4 weeks (T1) from baseline. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include changes in meat consumption at 8 weeks (T2) from baseline and changes from the baseline to both follow-up in other aspects of participants diet, putative psychosocial determinants of eating a low meat diet and of using meat substitutes and biomarkers of health risk, including blood lipid profiles, blood pressure, weight and body composition. Linear models will be employed to explore whether the changes in each of the aforementioned outcomes differ significantly between the control and intervention group. Qualitative interviews on a subsample of participants receiving the intervention will evaluate their experiences of the intervention and help to identify the mechanisms through which the intervention reduced meat consumption or the barriers preventing the intervention to aid this dietary transition. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been granted ethical approval by the Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee (IDREC) of the University of Oxford (Ref: R54329/RE001). All results originating from this study will be submitted for publication in scientific journals and presented at meetings and through the media.

 abstract = {Recent years have been marked by an increased interest in alternative proteins as food sources. Protein choices are no longer limited to traditional plant and animal proteins; rather, there is a growing interest in proteins from novel approaches applied to various plants, insects, and cell-cultured or fermented sources. Global trade and economic growth are fueling shifts in nutritional preferences and new consumer demands are placing pressure on traditional supply chains and are demanding greater transparency about what they eat. As this trend in alternative proteins gains momentum, an exploration of the food safety and nutritional impact is required. Food regulators are working to keep pace with developments in food technology and safety. Meanwhile, the increasing global access to ingredients has complicated questions on the impact for nutrition science. To better understand the broad landscape, a Future Foods Symposium on Alternative Protein Sources was hosted by ILSI North America. The Symposium was organized into six sessions: 1) Enabling Technologies; 2) Impact on Agricultural Systems; 3) Consumer Beliefs; 4) Public Acceptance; 5) Nutrition Challenges and Opportunities; and, 6) Food Safety Considerations, and was attended by over 100 scientists and stakeholders from academia, government, industry, and research organizations. Unanimously, the speakers echoed the message that public perception and acceptance are critical to the success of an evolving food system and that in addition to science creating optimized products, there must be strong communication and messaging for the public to understand and accept alternative proteins. {\copyright} 2020 The Authors},

We demonstrate that classification accuracy degrades linearly with the degree to which that assumption is violated, and in practice it is always violated. By incorporating environment-specific taxonomic abundance information, we demonstrate a significant increase in the species-level classification accuracy across common sample types. At the species level, overall average error rates decline from 25{\%} to 14{\%}, which is favourably comparable to the error rates that existing classifiers achieve at the genus level (16{\%}). Our findings indicate that for most practical purposes, the assumption that reference species are equally likely to be observed is untenable. q2-clawback provides a straightforward alternative for samples from common environments.},

Spontaneous kimchi fermentation in unsterilized raw materials leads to the growth of various lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which results in variations in the taste and sensory qualities of kimchi products and difficulties in the standardized industrial production of kimchi. Raw materials, kimchi varieties, ingredients, and fermentation conditions have significant effects on the microbial communities and fermentative characteristics of kimchi during fermentation. Heterofermentative LAB belonging to the genera Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Weissella are likely to be key players in kimchi fermentation and have been subjected to genomic and functional studies to gain a better understanding of the fermentation process and beneficial effects of kimchi. The use of starter cultures has been considered for the industrial production of high quality, standardized kimchi.

 abstract = {Kimchi is often stored for a long period of time for a diet during the winter season because it is an essential side dish for Korean meals. In this study pH, abundance of bacteria and yeasts, bacterial communities, and metabolites were monitored periodically to investigate the fermentation process of kimchi for 120 d. Bacterial abundance increased quickly with a pH decrease after an initial pH increase during the early fermentation period. After 20 d, pH values became relatively stable and free sugars were maintained at relatively constant levels, indicating that kimchi fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was almost completed. After that time, a decrease in bacterial abundance and a growth in Saccharomyces occurred concurrently with increased free sugar consumption and production of glycerol and ethanol. Finally, after 100 d, the growth of Candida was observed. Community analysis using pyrosequencing revealed that diverse LAB including Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc holzapfelii, Lactococcus lactis, and Weissella soli were present during the early fermentation period, but the LAB community was quickly replaced with Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc gasicomitatum, and Weissella koreensis as the fermentation progressed. Metabolite analysis using (1) H-NMR showed that organic acids (lactate, acetate, and succinate) as well as bioactive substances (mannitol and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)) were produced during the kimchi fermentation, and Leuconostoc strains and Lactobacillus sakei were identified as the producers of mannitol and GABA, respectively.},

Domestic storage is the last, and in many respects the most important, link in the food chill chain. Inadequate domestic refrigeration or cooling is frequently cited as a factor in incidents of food poisoning. The authors reviewed the temperature performance of refrigerators in 2008. This new review builds on that review, covering studies that have been published since (and those that were unfortunately missed in the first review), and also seeks to put this important stage of the food cold chain in its context. It is clear from the published data that many refrigerators throughout the world are running at higher than recommended temperatures. It is also clear that, despite improvements in energy use, the temperature performance and use of refrigerators have not changed significantly in the last 40 or so years. Many householders still remain unaware of the recommended refrigeration temperature range, how to ensure that the correct refrigeration temperature range is achieved, the importance of monitoring that it is being maintained, and the potential hazards of temperature abuse.},

 abstract = {Many fermented foods containing vegetable leaves are mostly consumed in the world, particularly in Africa and Asia. These widespread foods represent the basic diet, in addition to their raw materials available, and constitute a significant share in the food of the local populations. Kawal, obtained by natural and alkaline fermentation of Senna obtusifolia also called Cassia obtusifolia leaves, is a much-appreciated food and largely consumed by the populations in Chad and Sudan. S. obtusifolia leaves play an important role in the food system for many communities in Africa. They are rich in essential amino acids and can be regarded as products of nutritional interest. The kawal contains considerable quantities of proteins and is used as a meat substitute. It is also rich in mineral salts and carbohydrates. The kawal technology production remains traditional with rudimentary equipment and an uncontrolled fermentation. However, this fermentation, although traditional, allows the elimination of the antinutritional factors contained in the leaves and also contributes to the improvement of the nutritional value and the development of aromatic compounds. It also makes it possible to increase the bioavailability of minerals and thus reduces the deficiency problems in humans. Bacillus and Lactobacillus genus in kawal play different beneficial roles to humans. Indeed, the kawal can be a source of probiotic microorganisms when the product is consumed without a stage of cooking after fermentation, thus keeping the probiotics alive and able to exert their beneficial effects for health. The transformation of this product constitutes a significant stake because of the generated incomes and thus contributes to the valorization of the forest resources and food safety. The technologies of the transformation of kawal not being well controlled and varying from one area to another, in the sight of an improvement, it is necessary to make a review on technologies of its transformation and on its nutritional value. {\copyright} Afr.

Ces aliments tr{\`e}s r{\'e}pandus, repr{\'e}sentent le r{\'e}gime de base en plus de leurs mati{\`e}res premi{\`e}res disponibles et constituent une part importante dans l'alimentation des populations locales. Le kawal obtenu par fermentation naturelle et alcaline des feuilles de Senna obtusifolia encore appel{\'e} Cassia obtusifolia, est un aliment tr{\`e}s appr{\'e}ci{\'e} et largement consomm{\'e} par les populations au Tchad et au Soudan. Les feuilles de S. obtusifolia occupent une place importante dans le syst{\`e}me alimentaire de nombreuses communaut{\'e}s en Afrique. Elles sont riches en acides amin{\'e}s essentiels et peuvent {\^e}tre consid{\'e}r{\'e}es comme des produits d'int{\'e}r{\^e}t nutritionnel de par leur valeur prot{\'e}ique. Le kawal contient des quantit{\'e}s appr{\'e}ciables de prot{\'e}ines et est utilis{\'e} comme substitut de viande et ou de poisson. Il est {\'e}galement riche en hydrates de carbone et en sels min{\'e}raux. La technologie de production du kawal reste traditionnelle avec des {\'e}quipements rudimentaires et une fermentation incontr{\^o}l{\'e}e. Cependant, cette technique de fermentation bien que traditionnelle permet l'{\'e}limination des facteurs antinutritionnels contenus dans les feuilles. Elle contribue aussi {\`a} l'am{\'e}lioration de la valeur nutritionnelle et au d{\'e}veloppement de compos{\'e}s aromatiques tout en permettant d'augmenter la biodisponibilit{\'e} des min{\'e}raux aboutissant ainsi {\`a} un produit qui permet de r{\'e}duire les probl{\`e}mes de carences en min{\'e}raux chez l'Homme. Les bact{\'e}ries fermentaires du kawal, principalement celles des genres Bacillus et Lactobacillus du fait de leurs aptitudes probiotiques sont b{\'e}n{\'e}fiques pour la sant{\'e} humaine. La transformation de ce produit constitue un enjeu {\'e}conomique important en raison des revenus g{\'e}n{\'e}r{\'e}s et contribue ainsi {\`a} la valorisation des ressources v{\'e}g{\'e}tales et {\`a} la s{\'e}curit{\'e} alimentaire des populations. Les technologies de la transformation du kawal n'{\'e}tant pas bien maitris{\'e}es et variant d'une r{\'e}gion {\`a} l'autre et ou d'une productrice {\`a} une autre il est donc indispensable de faire une synth{\`e}se sur les technologies de sa transformation et sa valeur nutritionnelle en vue de son am{\'e}lioration. {\copyright} Afr.

@article{Kimoto.1997,
 abstract = {This study was designed to assess the potential toxicity of pullulan, a starch-like substance produced by Aureobasidium pullulans that is proposed for use as a texturizer for meat and meat substitutes and as a flavour substrate. Sprague-Dawley rats (15/sex/group) were administered pullulan as a dietary admixture at levels of 1, 5 and 10{\%} for a period of 62 wk. Control animals (15/sex) received untreated standard laboratory diet. The feeding study, originally intended to continue for 24 months, was terminated at 62 wk due to poor survival resulting from intercurrent pneumonia which was confirmed by histological findings. At 62 wk of treatment, all survivors were killed, complete gross post-mortem examinations were conducted on all animals, selected organs were weighed and organ/body weight and organ/brain weight ratios calculated. Mean body weights of all treated groups were comparable to controls. There were no indications of an adverse effect of pullulan on food consumption or food efficiency. At termination of the study, haematology and clinical chemistry values of treated animals were comparable to control values. There was no indication of pullulan-related toxicity in terminal organ and body weights. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations revealed no toxic lesions due to treatment. The mutagenicity of pullulan was assessed with and without metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium (TA100, TA1535, TA98 and TA1537). Pullulan did not increase the number of revertants per plate in any strain at any dose, including 10,000 \textgreek{m}g/plate with or without metabolic activation, suggesting that it lacks mutagenic/carcinogenic potential on the basis of these results, it is concluded that pullulan lacks significant toxicological activity. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was 10{\%} (equal to or greater than 4450 mg/kg body weight/day in males and 5080 mg/kg body weight/day in females) which would support use in various foods as a substrate for flavours.},

@article{Koduru.2017,
 abstract = {Obligate heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are well-known for their beneficial health effects in humans. To delineate the incompletely characterized metabolism that currently limits their exploitation, at systems-level, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model of the representative obligate heterofermenting LAB, Leuconostoc mesenteroides (iLME620). Constraint-based flux analysis was then used to simulate several qualitative and quantitative phenotypes of L. mesenteroides, thereby evaluating the model validity. With established predictive capabilities, we subsequently employed iLME620 to elucidate unique metabolic characteristics of L. mesenteroides, such as the limited ability to utilize amino acids as energy source, and to substantiate the role of malolactic fermentation (MLF) in the reduction of pH-homeostatic burden on F0F1-ATPase. We also reported new hypothesis on the MLF mechanism that could be explained via a substrate channelling-like phenomenon mainly influenced by intracellular redox state rather than the intermediary reactions. Model simulations further revealed possible proton-symporter dependent activity of the energy efficient glucose-phosphotransferase system in obligate heterofermentative LAB. Moreover, integrated transcriptomic analysis allowed us to hypothesize transcriptional regulatory bias affecting the intracellular redox state. The insights gained here about the low ATP-yielding metabolism of L. mesenteroides, dominantly controlled by the cellular redox state, could potentially aid strain design for probiotic and cell factory applications.},

 abstract = {Many bacterial species have been found to exist in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state since its discovery in 1982. VBNC cells are characterized by a loss of culturability on routine agar, which impairs their detection by conventional plate count techniques. This leads to an underestimation of total viable cells in environmental or clinical samples, and thus poses a risk to public health. In this review, we present recent findings on the VBNC state of human bacterial pathogens. The characteristics of VBNC cells, including the similarities and differences to viable, culturable cells and dead cells, and different detection methods are discussed. Exposure to various stresses can induce the VBNC state, and VBNC cells may be resuscitated back to culturable cells under suitable stimuli. The conditions that trigger the induction of the VBNC state and resuscitation from it are summarized and the mechanisms underlying these two processes are discussed. Last but not least, the significance of VBNC cells and their potential influence on human health are also reviewed.},

 abstract = {Kimchi is a traditional Korean vegetable product that is naturally fermented by various microorganisms present in the raw materials. Among these microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria dominate the fermentation process. Natural fermentation with unsterilized raw materials leads to the growth of various lactic acid bacteria, resulting in variations in the taste and quality of kimchi, which may make it difficult to produce industrial-scale kimchi with consistent quality. The use of starter cultures has been considered as an alternative for the industrial production of standardized kimchi, and recent trends suggest that the demand for starter cultures is on the rise. However, several factors should be carefully considered for the successful application of starter cultures for kimchi fermentation. In this review, we summarize recent studies on kimchi starter cultures, describe practical problems in the application of industrial-scale kimchi production, and discuss the directions for further studies.},

The accuracy of these analyses depends strongly on the choice of primers. The overall coverage and phylum spectrum of 175 primers and 512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect to the SILVA 16S/18S rDNA non-redundant reference dataset (SSURef 108 NR). Based on this evaluation a selection of 'best available' primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, $\geq$ 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies.},

Structural changes of extruded pea flour were determined at different scales by measurements of density (expansion), crystallinity (X-ray diffraction), gelatinisation enthalpy (DSC), starch solubility in water and protein solubility in SDS and DTE (SE-HPLC). Foam density dropped from 820 to 85 kg/m3 with increase in SME and T (R2 $\geq$ 0.78). DSC and XRD results showed that starch was amorphous whatever extrusion conditions. Its solubility in water augmented up to 50{\%}. Increasing temperature from 115 to 165 °C decreased proteins soluble in SDS from 95 to 35{\%} (R2 = 0.83) of total proteins, whereas the proteins soluble in DTE increased from 5 to 45{\%} (R2 = 0.75) of total proteins. These trends could be described by sigmoid models, which allowed determining onset temperatures for changes of protein solubility in the interval [125, 146 °C], whatever moisture content. The SME impact on protein solubility followed similar trends. These results suggest the creation of protein network by SS bonds, implicating larger SDS-insoluble protein aggregates, as a result of increasing T and SME, accompanied by creation of covalent bonds other than SS ones. CSLM images suggested that extruded pea flour had a composite morphology that changed from dispersed small protein aggregates to a bi-continuous matrix of large protein aggregates and amorphous starch. This morphology would govern the expansion of pea flour by extrusion.},

We benchmark Flye against five state-of-the-art assemblers and show that it generates better or comparable assemblies, while being an order of magnitude faster. Flye nearly doubled the contiguity of the human genome assembly (as measured by the NGA50 assembly quality metric) compared with existing assemblers.},

@article{Feskens.2013,
 abstract = {Several prospective studies have reported that risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is elevated in meat consumers, especially when processed meats are consumed. Elevated risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in meat consumers have also been reported. In this overview, the evidence regarding meat consumption and the risk of diabetes, both type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and T2DM and their macro- and microvascular complications, is reviewed. For T2DM, we performed a new meta-analysis including publications up to October 2012. For T1DM, only a few studies have reported increased risks for meat consumers or for high intake of saturated fatty acids and nitrates and nitrites. For T2DM, CHD, and stroke, the evidence is strongest. Per 100 g of total meat, the pooled relative risk (RR) for T2DM is 1.15 (95 {\%} CI 1.07-1.24), for (unprocessed) red meat 1.13 (95 {\%} CI 1.03-1.23), and for poultry 1.04 (95 {\%} CI 0.99-1.33); per 50 g of processed meat, the pooled RR is 1.32 (95 {\%} CI 1.19-1.48). Hence, the strongest association regarding T2DM is observed for processed (red) meat. A similar observation has been made for CHD. For stroke, however, a recent meta-analysis shows moderately elevated risks for meat consumers, for processed as well as for fresh meats. For the microvascular complications of diabetes, few prospective data were available, but suggestions for elevated risks can be derived from findings on hyperglycemia and hypertension. The results are discussed in the light of the typical nutrients and other compounds present in meat--that is, saturated and trans fatty acids, dietary cholesterol, protein and amino acids, heme-iron, sodium, nitrites and nitrosamines, and advanced glycation end products. In light of these findings, a diet moderate to low in red meat, unprocessed and lean, and prepared at moderate temperatures is probably the best choice from the public health point of view.},

@article{Fernandez.2015,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

It is well understood that distinct communities of bacteria are present at different sites of the body, and that changes in the structure of these communities have strong implications for human health. Yet, challenges remain in understanding the complex interconnections between the bacterial taxa within these microbial communities and how they change during the progression of diseases. Many recent studies attempt to analyze the human microbiome using traditional ecological measures and cataloging differences in bacterial community membership. In this paper, we show how to push metagenomic analyses beyond mundane questions related to the bacterial taxonomic profiles that differentiate one sample from another.

METHODS

We develop tools and techniques that help us to investigate the nature of social interactions in microbial communities, and demonstrate ways of compactly capturing extensive information about these networks and visually conveying them in an effective manner. We define the concept of bacterial {\textquotedbl}social clubs{\textquotedbl}, which are groups of taxa that tend to appear together in many samples. More importantly, we define the concept of {\textquotedbl}rival clubs{\textquotedbl}, entire groups that tend to avoid occurring together in many samples. We show how to efficiently compute social clubs and rival clubs and demonstrate their utility with the help of examples including a smokers' dataset and a dataset from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP).

RESULTS

The tools developed provide a framework for analyzing relationships between bacterial taxa modeled as bacterial co-occurrence networks. The computational techniques also provide a framework for identifying clubs and rival clubs and for studying differences in the microbiomes (and their interactions) of two or more collections of samples.

CONCLUSIONS

Microbial relationships are similar to those found in social networks. In this work, we assume that strong (positive or negative) tendencies to co-occur or co-infect is likely to have biological, physiological, or ecological significance, possibly as a result of cooperation or competition. As a consequence of the analysis, a variety of biological interpretations are conjectured. In the human microbiome context, the pattern of strength of interactions between bacterial taxa is unique to body site.},

This study examined the functionality of local yellow pea and faba bean protein isolates/concentrate as meat analogue products. The most critical factors affecting the texture properties of meat analogue were also determined. Extrusion was used to produce high-moisture meat analogues (HMMAs) from yellow pea and faba bean protein isolates/concentrates and HMMAs with fibrous layered structures was successfully produced from both imported commercial and local sources. The texture properties of the HMMA produced were mainly affected by the ash, fiber and protein content and water-holding capacity of the source protein. Three extrusion process parameters (target moisture content, extrusion temperature, screw speed), also significantly affected HMMA texture. In conclusion, functional HMMA can be produced using protein isolates derived from locally grown pulses.},

 abstract = {Pseudomonas putida is widely recognized as a spoiler of fresh foods under cold storage, and recently associated also with infections in clinical settings. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) could be acquired and transmitted by horizontal genetic transfer and further increase the risk associated with its persistence in food and the need to be deeper investigated. Thus, in this work we presented a genomic and phenotypic analysis of the psychrotrophic P.~putida ITEM 17297 to provide new insight into AR mechanisms by this species until now widely studied only for its spoilage traits. ITEM 17297 displayed resistance to several classes of antibiotics and it also formed huge amounts of biofilm; this latter registered increases at 15~​°C in comparison to the optimum growth condition (30~​°C). After ITEM 17297 biofilms exposure to antibiotic concentrations higher than 10-fold their MIC values no eradication occurred; interestingly, biomasses of biofilm cultivated at 15~​°C increased their amount in a dose-dependent manner. Genomic analyses revealed determinants (RND-systems, ABC-transporters, and MFS-efflux pumps) for multi-drugs resistance (\textgreek{b}-lactams, macrolides, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, fusidic acid and bacitracin) and a novel ampC allele. Biofilm and motility related pathways were depicted underlying their contribution to AR. Based on these results, underestimated psychrotrophic pseudomonas, such as the herein studied ITEM 17297 strain, might assume relevance in relation to the risk associated with the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes to humans through cold stored contaminated foods. P.~putida biofilm and AR related molecular targets herein identified will provide a basis to clarify the interaction between AR and biofilm formation and to develop novel strategies to counteract the persistence of multidrug resistant P.~putida in the food chain.},

@article{Francoise.2010,
 abstract = {Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fish flesh has long been disregarded because the high post-mortem pH, the low percentage of sugars, the high content of low molecular weight nitrogenous molecules and the low temperature of temperate waters favor the rapid growth of pH-sensitive psychrotolerant marine Gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas, Shewanella and Photobacterium. In seafood packed in both vacuum (VP) and modified atmosphere (MAP) packaging commonly CO(2) enriched, the growth of the Gram-negative aerobic bacteria group (predominantly pseudomonads) is effectively inhibited and the number reached by LAB during storage is higher than that achieved in air but always several log units lower than the trimethylamine oxide (TMA-O) reducing and CO(2)-resistant organisms (Shewanella putrefaciens and Photobacterium phosphoreum). Accordingly, LAB are not of much concern in seafood neither aerobically stored nor VP and MAP. However, they may acquire great relevance in lightly preserved fish products (LPFP), including those VP or MAP. Fresh fish presents a very high water activity (aw) value (0.99). However, aw is reduced to about 0.96 when salt (typically 6{\%} WP) is added to the product. As a result, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria are inhibited, which allows the growth of other organisms more resistant to reduced aw, i.e. LAB, and then they may acquire a central role in the microbial events occurring in the product. Changes in consumers' habits have led to an increase of convenient LPFP with a relative long shelf-life (at least 3 weeks) which, on the other hand, may constitute a serious problem from a safety perspective since Listeria monocytogenes and sometimes Clostridium botulinum (mainly type E) may able to grow. In any case the LAB function in marine products is complex, depending on species, strains, interaction with other bacteria and the food matrix. They may have no particular effect or they may be responsible for spoilage and, in certain cases, they may even exert a bioprotective effect in relation to undesirable bacteria. The bioprotective potential of endogenous LAB in relation to pathogens and spoiling bacteria has often been highlighted. However, the technology is still in its infancy compared with foods dairy and meat products in which either the carbohydrate content (dairy products) or sugar and salt added (meat products) favor the acidification by LAB that enable a natural preservation of the product. Successful studies on LAB as probiotic for fish intensify, but this potential is still to be explored for human. Although not usual, some applications of LAB for fermentation of marine products and by-products are described.},

 abstract = {Background: Whole muscle meat, meat products, and seafood contain different nutrients in adequate quantity providing a better environment for presence and replication of different microorganisms. There are underreported and inaccurate estimations of foodborne diseases due to the lack of effective surveillance systems in Libya. Aim: To determine the extent of microbiological contamination of whole muscle meat, meat products, and seafood. Methods: A total number of 731 samples of retail meat were collected from different stores in four cities in Libya. Samples were analyzed for aerobic plate count and subjected to microbiological enumeration and isolation techniques, followed by molecular identification by PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA. Results: The results showed contamination of samples with enteric and spoilage bacteria. Fifteen genera of spoilage bacteria yielded 149 isolates which were detected and identified by PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA as: Proteus spp., Provedencia spp., Raouttella ornithinolytical, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morgi, Shewanella algea, Rhodobacter capsulatus, Listonella pelagia, Kluyvera spp., Pectobacterium spp., Brenneria spp., Klebsiella spp., Acintobacter radioresistens, and Pantoea spp. While for pathogenic bacteria, 143 isolates distributed among nine genera were identified by PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA as: Bacillus spp., Escherichia spp., Shigella spp., Enterococci spp., Cronobacter spp., Staphylococci spp., Salmonella spp., Aeromonas spp., and Vibrio spp.. Many isolated bacteria are zoonotic bacteria with high importance for public health. Conclusion: Excessive handling and processing of meat and meat products seems to be one of the poorest microbiological qualities. These findings ought to be helpful in risk assessments and quality assurance of meat in order to improve food safety. {\copyright} 2020, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

 abstract = {Consumer demands for plant-based products have increased in recent years. However, their consumption is still limited due to the presence of off-flavor compounds, primarily beany and green notes, which are mainly associated with the presence of aldehydes, ketones, furans, and alcohols. To overcome this problem, fermentation is used as a lever to reduce off-flavors. A starter culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was tested in a 4{\%} pea protein solution with one of the following yeasts: Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, or Torulaspora delbrueckii. The fermented samples were evaluated by a sensory panel. Non-fermented and fermented matrices were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the volatile compounds. The sensory evaluation showed a significant reduction in the green/leguminous attributes of pea proteins and the generation of new descriptors in the presence of yeasts. Compared to the non-fermented matrix, fermentations with LAB or LAB and yeasts led to the degradation of many off-flavor compounds. Moreover, the presence of yeasts triggered the generation of esters. Thus, fermentation by a co-culture of LAB and yeasts can be used as a powerful tool for the improvement of the sensory perception of a pea protein-based product.},

 abstract = {It is not uncommon to treat plant-derived foods and feeds with alkali. Such exposure to high pH is being used to recover proteins from cereals and legumes, to induce the formation of fiber-forming meat analogue vegetable protein, for preparing peeled fruits and vegetables, and for destroying microorganisms. In addition to their profound effects on functional and nutritional properties in such foods, such treatments may also cause other side reactions, including the destruction of natural polyphenolic compounds. Because plants contain a large number of structurally different antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antimicrobial polyphenolic compounds, it is of interest to know whether such compounds are stable to heat and to high pH. In this model study, the stability of the following natural polyphenols to pH in the range 3-11 was studied with the aid of ultraviolet spectroscopy: caffeic acid, (-)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, (-)- epigallocatechin, rutin, and the nonphenolic compound trans-cinnamic acid. This study demonstrates that caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids are not stable to high pH and that the pH- and time-dependent spectral transformations are not reversible. By contrast, chlorogenic acid is stable to acid pH, to heat, and to storage when added to apple juice. (-)-Catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, ferulic acid, rutin, and trans-cinnamic acid resisted major pH-induced degradation. The results are rationalized in terms of relative resonance stabilization of phenoxide ions and quinone oxidation intermediates. The possible significance of these findings to food chemistry and microbiology is discussed.},

 abstract = {The topic of plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) has been discussed for several decades, but it has only recently become one of the hottest topics in the food and research communities. With the purpose of investigating the current situation of scientific research on PBMA and determining future research opportunities, the driving forces for PBMA development, a brief history of its progression, key technologies required for production, and the resulting consumer attitudes are summarized. Environmental, human health, and animal welfare concerns are the main factors that have driven the development of PBMA. Although its history can trace back to ancient Asian civilizations, the first generation of PBMA originated in 1960s and a new generation of PBMA designed for carnivore was developed in recently years. Structuring methods such as extrusion and shear cell techniques have been widely studied, but improvements toward the overall appearance and flavor, biological and chemical safety control, as well as the selection of protein sources are also very important for PBMA production. The consumer acceptance of PBMA remains unsatisfactory but is continually improving. Based on those knowledge, future research opportunities include developing more effective strategies for consumer education, providing more scientific evidence for the health properties of PBMA, finding more suitable protein sources to improve the quality of the final products, improving the appearance and flavor, further examining and securing the chemical safety, exploring the structure formation mechanism during the extraction or shearing processes, and developing methods and standards for a quality evaluation of PBMA. {\copyright} 2020 Institute of Food Technologists{\circledR}},

@article{Hawthorne.2018,
 abstract = {Purpose: Parents influence the foods their children consume and often provide proxy reports of this intake. One way parents exert this influence is by providing home-packed lunches. This study compared parental reports of foods packed in children's lunches with what was actually packed and identified parental barriers and facilitators to packing lunches. Methods: Grade 3 and 4 student--parent dyads (n = 321) in 19 elementary schools in Ontario participated. Parental reports and actual packed lunch contents were collected via self-administered surveys and direct observation, respectively. Parental barriers and facilitators were obtained through open and closed survey questions. Results: Median portions packed were significantly higher for sugar-sweetened beverages and snacks and significantly lower for fruits, fruit juice, vegetables, milk/alternatives, and meat/alternatives than parents reported. Packing a healthy lunch was ``important/very important/of the utmost importance'' for 95.9{\%} of respondents, and 97.5{\%} perceived their nutrition knowledge as ``adequate/good/very good''. Barriers to packing a lunch included: child's food preferences, time, finances, allergy policies, and food safety. Nutrition resources, observing other children's lunches, child's input, and planning ahead were identified as facilitators. Conclusions: Strategies to improve packed lunches should move beyond parental nutrition knowledge and importance of lunch packing to address parental barriers and facilitators. {\copyright} 2018 Dietitians of Canada.

@article{Harrison.2021,
 abstract = {To characterize microbiomes and other ecological assemblages, ecologists routinely sequence and compare loci that differ among focal taxa. Counts of these sequences convey information regarding the occurrence and relative abundances of taxa, but provide no direct measure of their absolute abundances, due to the technical limitations of the sequencing process. The relative abundances in compositional data are inherently constrained and difficult to interpret. The incorporation of internal standards (ISDs; colloquially referred to as 'spike-ins') into DNA pools can ameliorate the problems posed by relative abundance data and allow absolute abundances to be approximated. Unfortunately, many laboratory and sampling biases cause ISDs to underperform or fail. Here, we discuss how careful deployment of ISDs can avoid these complications and be an integral component of well-designed studies seeking to characterize ecological assemblages via sequencing of DNA.},

 abstract = {Food security and environmental issues have become global crises that need transformative solutions. As livestock production is becoming less sustainable, alternative sources of proteins are urgently required. These include cultured meat, plant-based meat, insect protein and single-cell protein. Here, we describe the food safety aspects of these novel protein sources, in terms of their technological backgrounds, environmental impacts and the necessary regulatory framework for future mass-scale production. Briefly, cultured meat grown in fetal bovine serum-based media can be exposed to viruses or infectious prion, in addition to other safety risks associated with the use of genetic engineering. Plant-based meat may contain allergens, anti-nutrients and thermally induced carcinogens. Microbiological risks and allergens are the primary concerns associated with insect protein. Single-cell protein sources are divided into microalgae, fungi and bacteria, all of which have specific food safety risks that include toxins, allergens and high ribonucleic acid (RNA) contents. The environmental impacts of these alternative proteins can mainly be attributed to the production of growth substrates or during cultivation. Legislations related to novel food or genetic modification are the relevant regulatory framework to ensure the safety of alternative proteins. Lastly, additional studies on the food safety aspects of alternative proteins are urgently needed for providing relevant food governing authorities with sufficient data to oversee that the technological progress in this area is balanced with robust safety standards.},

 abstract = {The production of ready-to-eat meat alternatives is currently on the rise, due to societal lifestyle trends, including flexitarianism, vegetarianism, and veganism. They usually consist of either processed meat substitutes that have been derived from plants or edible insects, depending on the market niche. Since the market relevance of such products has only recently become of importance, little is known about their associated microbial communities. The latter are nevertheless important because of their potential role in spoilage and food safety. In this study, several ready-to-eat meat alternatives in the Belgian market were analysed (including 8 vegetarian and 6 vegan imitations of meat products as well as one insect sample). Bacterial counts were relatively low compared to meat products, ranging from {\textless}2.0 to 8.7 log cfu g$-$1, with differences between the various products. The bacterial load on the edible insect sample was generally higher than those on vegan and vegetarian products. In total, 426 isolates were collected from different selective agar media and classified and identified using (GTG)5-PCR fingerprinting, followed by gene sequencing. Isolates retrieved from the vegetarian products consisted mostly of Lactobacillus sakei. The majority of the isolates originating from the vegan products also belonged to the species Lb. sakei, Enterococcus faecium, and Carnobacterium divergens, whereas the insect product mainly contained E. faecium, besides the presence of Macrococcus caseolyticus and Cronobacter sakazakii. The occasional presence of relatively high levels of enterococci merits attention in view of food safety. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Ganzle.2012,
 abstract = {Oligosaccharides, compounds that are composed of 2-10 monosaccharide residues, are major carbohydrate sources in habitats populated by lactobacilli. Moreover, oligosaccharide metabolism is essential for ecological fitness of lactobacilli. Disaccharide metabolism by lactobacilli is well understood; however, few data on the metabolism of higher oligosaccharides are available. Research on the ecology of intestinal microbiota as well as the commercial application of prebiotics has shifted the interest from (digestible) disaccharides to (indigestible) higher oligosaccharides. This review provides an overview on oligosaccharide metabolism in lactobacilli. Emphasis is placed on maltodextrins, isomalto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, and raffinose-family oligosaccharides. Starch is also considered. Metabolism is discussed on the basis of metabolic studies related to oligosaccharide metabolism, information on the cellular location and substrate specificity of carbohydrate transport systems, glycosyl hydrolases and phosphorylases, and the presence of metabolic genes in genomes of 38 strains of lactobacilli. Metabolic pathways for disaccharide metabolism often also enable the metabolism of tri- and tetrasaccharides. However, with the exception of amylase and levansucrase, metabolic enzymes for oligosaccharide conversion are intracellular and oligosaccharide metabolism is limited by transport. This general restriction to intracellular glycosyl hydrolases differentiates lactobacilli from other bacteria that adapted to intestinal habitats, particularly Bifidobacterium spp.},

 abstract = {One of the major breakthroughs in the history of medicine is undoubtedly the discovery of antibiotics. Their use in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine has resulted in healthier and more productive farm animals, ensuring the welfare and health of both animals and humans. Unfortunately, from the first use of penicillin, the resistance countdown started to tick. Nowadays, the infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are increasing, and resistance to antibiotics is probably the major public health problem. Antibiotic use in farm animals has been criticized for contributing to the emergence of resistance. The use and misuse of antibiotics in farm animal settings as growth promoters or as nonspecific means of infection prevention and treatment has boosted antibiotic consumption and resistance among bacteria in the animal habitat. This reservoir of resistance can be transmitted directly or indirectly to humans through food consumption and direct or indirect contact. Resistant bacteria can cause serious health effects directly or via the transmission of the antibiotic resistance traits to pathogens, causing illnesses that are difficult to treat and that therefore have higher morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, the selection and proliferation of antibiotic-resistant strains can be disseminated to the environment via animal waste, enhancing the resistance reservoir that exists in the environmental microbiome. In this review, an effort is made to highlight the various factors that contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in farm animals and to provide some insights into possible solutions to this major health issue.},

This study aims to characterize the biofilm produced by mono- and dual-species of Shewanella baltica and Pseudomonas fluorescens as fish spoilers at the different incubation temperature, and to elucidate the interactive behaviour of dual-species biofilm development.

METHODS AND RESULTS

The mono- and dual-species biofilm formation and adhesion characteristics of S. baltica and P. fluorescens were evaluated by using crystal violet staining, scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results showed that P. fluorescens had significantly higher biofilm biomass and polysaccharides production than S. baltica, and two isolates reached the maximum biofilm biomass during the early stationary phase. Lower biomass and polysaccharides in dual-species biofilms were observed compared to mono-species of P. fluorescens. Meanwhile, S. baltica and P. fluorescens formed fragile and viscous pellicles with different spatial architectures respectively. In dual-species pellicle few large microcolonies were dominated by P. fluorescens. Compared to mono-species of PF07, adherent cell population and biofilm thickness at the developing phase significantly decreased, and biofilm-forming cycle prolonged in the dual-species biofilms. Biofilm formation and adhesion of mono- and dual-species at 4 or 15°C were significantly higher than at 30°C during the same phase. The culture supernatant extracts of the two spoilage strains greatly inhibited biofilm development to each other.

CONCLUSIONS

Shewanella baltica and P. fluorescens had different biofilm and pellicle characteristics, and the inhibitory development on dual-species biofilm was associated with the competitive interaction by the two psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY

This work contributes to a better understanding of interactive behaviour of multispecies biofilm communities by psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria at low temperature, which could contribute to further control contamination of spoilage organism during the preservation and processing of aquatic products.},

Here, we describe the first WGS-based characterization of isolates linked to an outbreak caused by members of the B. cereus group. In conjunction with a 2016 outbreak traced to a supplier of refried beans served by a fast food restaurant chain in upstate New York, a total of 33 B. cereus group isolates were obtained from human cases (n = 7) and food samples (n = 26). Emetic (n = 30) and diarrheal (n = 3) isolates were most closely related to B. paranthracis (group III) and B. cereus sensu stricto (group IV), respectively. WGS indicated that the 30 emetic isolates (24 and 6 from food and humans, respectively) were closely related and formed a well-supported clade distinct from publicly available emetic group III genomes with an identical sequence type (ST 26). The 30 emetic group III isolates from this outbreak differed from each other by a mean of 8.3 to 11.9 core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while differing from publicly available emetic group III ST 26 B. cereus group genomes by a mean of 301.7-528.0 core SNPs, depending on the SNP calling methodology used. Using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay, the strains isolated from this outbreak had only mild detrimental effects on HeLa cell metabolic activity compared to reference diarrheal strain B. cereus ATCC 14579. We hypothesize that the outbreak was a single source outbreak caused by emetic group III B. cereus belonging to the B. paranthracis species, although food samples were not tested for presence of the emetic toxin cereulide. In addition to showcasing how WGS can be used to characterize B. cereus group strains linked to a foodborne outbreak, we also discuss potential microbiological and epidemiological challenges presented by B. cereus group outbreaks, and we offer recommendations for analyzing WGS data from the isolates associated with them.},

 abstract = {Members of the Klebsiella oxytoca species complex (KoSC) are emerging human pathogens causing infections of increasing significance especially in healthcare settings. KoSC strains are affiliated with distinct phylogroups based on genetic variation at the beta-lactamase gene (blaOXY) and it has been proposed that each major phylogroup represents a unique species. However, since the typing methods applied in clinical settings cannot differentiate every species within the complex, existing clinical, epidemiological and DNA sequence data is frequently misclassified. Here we systematically examined the phylogenetic relationship of KoSC strains to evaluate robustness of existing typing methods and to provide a simple typing strategy for KoSC members that cannot be differentiated biochemically. Initial analysis of a collection of K. oxytoca, K. michiganensis, K. pasteurii, and K. grimontii strains of environmental origin showed robust correlation of core phylogeny and blaOXY grouping. Moreover, we identified species-specific accessory gene loci for these strains. Extension of species correlation using database entries initially failed. However, assessment of average nucleotide identities (ANI) and phylogenetic validations showed that nearly one third of isolates in public databases have been misidentified. Reclassification resulted in a robust reference strain set for reliable species identification of new isolates or for retyping of strains previously analyzed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Finally, we show convergence of ANI, core gene phylogeny, and accessory gene content for available KoSC genomes. We conclude that also the monophyletic members K. oxytoca, K. michiganensis, K. pasteurii and K. grimontii can be simply differentiated by a PCR strategy targeting blaOXY and accessory genes defined here.},

We characterized CP K. oxytoca isolates collected from different Spanish hospitals between January 2016 and October 2017. During the study period, 139 nonduplicate CP K. oxytoca isolates were identified; of these, 80 were studied in detail. Carbapenemase and extended-spectrum \textgreek{b}-lactamase genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), carried out on 12 representative isolates, was used to identify the resistome, to elucidate the phylogeny, and to determine the plasmids harboring carbapenemase genes. Forty-eight (60{\%}) isolates produced VIM-1, 30 (37.5{\%}) produced OXA-48, 3 (3.7{\%}) produced KPC-2, 2 (2.5{\%}) produced KPC-3, and 1 (1.2{\%}) produced NDM-1; 4 isolates coproduced two carbapenemases. By PFGE, 69 patterns were obtained from the 80 CP K. oxytoca isolates, and four well-defined clusters were detected: cluster 1 consisted of 11 OXA-48-producing isolates, and the other three clusters included VIM-1-producing isolates (5, 3, and 3 isolates, respectively). In the 12 sequenced isolates, the average number of acquired resistance genes was significantly higher in VIM-1-producing isolates (10.8) than in OXA-48-producing isolates (2.3). All 12 isolates had chromosomally encoded genes of the blaOXY-2 genotype, and by multilocus sequence typing, most belonged to sequence type 2 (ST2). Carbapenemase genes were carried by IncL, IncHI2, IncFII, IncN, IncC, and IncP6 plasmid types. The emergence of CP K. oxytoca was principally due to the spread of VIM-1- and OXA-48-producing isolates in which VIM-1- and OXA-48 were carried by IncL, IncHI2, IncFII, and IncN plasmids. ST2 and the genotype blaOXY-2 predominated among the 12 sequenced isolates.},

The multiplex capability and high yield of current day DNA-sequencing instruments has made bacterial whole genome sequencing a routine affair. The subsequent de novo assembly of reads into contigs has been well addressed. The final step of annotating all relevant genomic features on those contigs can be achieved slowly using existing web- and email-based systems, but these are not applicable for sensitive data or integrating into computational pipelines. Here we introduce Prokka, a command line software tool to fully annotate a draft bacterial genome in about 10 min on a typical desktop computer. It produces standards-compliant output files for further analysis or viewing in genome browsers.

The exponential growth in the amount of biological data is challenging to the current database in regard to big data analysis.

@article{Carroll.2020,
 abstract = {The Bacillus cereus group, also known as B. cereus sensu lato (s.l.), is a species complex comprising numerous closely related lineages, which vary in their ability to cause illness in humans and animals. The classification of B. cereus s.l. isolates into species-level taxonomic units is essential for facilitating communication between and among microbiologists, clinicians, public health officials, and industry professionals, but is not always straightforward. A recently proposed genomospecies-subspecies-biovar taxonomic framework aims to provide a standardized nomenclature for this species complex but relies heavily on whole-genome sequencing (WGS). It thus is unclear whether popular, low-cost typing methods (e.g., single- and multi-locus sequence typing) remain congruent with the proposed taxonomy. Here, we characterize 2,231 B. cereus s.l. genomes using a combination of in silico (i) average-nucleotide identity (ANI)-based genomospecies assignment, (ii) ANI-based subspecies assignment, (iii) seven-gene multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), (iv) single-locus panC group assignment, (v) rpoB allelic typing, and (vi) virulence factor detection. We show that sequence types (STs) assigned using MLST can be used for genomospecies assignment, and we provide a comprehensive list of ST/genomospecies associations. For panC group assignment, we show that an adjusted, eight-group framework is largely, albeit not perfectly, congruent with the proposed eight-genomospecies taxonomy, as panC alone may not distinguish (i) B. luti from Group II B. mosaicus and (ii) B. paramycoides from Group VI B. mycoides. We additionally provide a list of loci that capture the topology of the whole-genome B. cereus s.l. phylogeny that may be used in future sequence typing efforts. For researchers with access to WGS, MLST, and/or panC data, we showcase how our recently released software, BTyper3 (https://github.com/lmc297/BTyper3), can be used to assign B. cereus s.l. isolates to taxonomic units within this proposed framework with little-to-no user intervention or domain-specific knowledge of B. cereus s.l. taxonomy. We additionally outline a novel method for assigning B. cereus s.l. genomes to pseudo-gene flow units within proposed genomospecies. The results presented here highlight the backward-compatibility and accessibility of the recently proposed genomospecies-subspecies-biovar taxonomic framework and illustrate that WGS is not a necessity for microbiologists who want to use the proposed nomenclature effectively.},

 abstract = {Latilactobacillus sakei (L. sakei), widely used as a starter culture in fermented sausages, is a species adapted to meat environments. Its ability to survive for a long time in such products is due to the exploitation of different metabolic pathways to gain energy (hexose and pentose sugar fermentation, amino acids catabolism, etc.). Since L. sakei demonstrates high phenotypic and metabolic strain biodiversity, in this work, a metabolomic approach was used to compare five strains of different origins. They were cultivated in a defined medium with glucose or ribose at two concentrations, and analyzed through nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy to monitor amino acid consumptions and accumulation of organic acids and aroma compounds. The results showed that all the strains were able to use arginine, especially when cultivated with ribose, while serine was consumed mainly in the presence of glucose. Aroma compounds (i.e., diacetyl and acetoin) were mainly accumulated in samples with ribose. These aspects are relevant for starter cultures selection, to confer specific features to fermented sausages, and to optimize the fermentations. Moreover, the use of 1H-NMR allowed the fast identification of different classes of compounds (without derivatization or extraction procedures), providing a powerful tool to increase the knowledge of the metabolic diversity of L. sakei.},

@article{Gorissen.2018,
 abstract = {The postprandial rise in essential amino acid (EAA) concentrations modulates the increase in muscle protein synthesis rates after protein ingestion. The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC-MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21{\%}), lupin (21{\%}), and wheat (22{\%}) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43{\%}, milk 39{\%}, casein 34{\%}, and egg 32{\%}) and muscle protein (38{\%}). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1{\%} for hemp to 13.5{\%} for corn protein, compared to 9.0{\%} for milk, 7.0{\%} for egg, and 7.6{\%} for muscle protein. Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0 $\pm$ 0.3 and 3.6 $\pm$ 0.6{\%}) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 and 7.0 $\pm$ 0.6{\%}) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8{\%}, respectively). In conclusion, there are large differences in EAA contents and AA composition between various plant-based protein isolates. Combinations of various plant-based protein isolates or blends of animal and plant-based proteins can provide protein characteristics that closely reflect the typical characteristics of animal-based proteins.},
