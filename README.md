# for Narciso :-)

so right now, there is an R file called Rworking.R that call all the separate R files in the correct order, also with comments when to do it (only the first time, optional and so on), the first time and optional stuff in the code is inactivated by #.

further there is a extra folder called VeggieMeat, that contains the R markdown file for the manuscript. That is a mess right now, because I just started to use this for manuscript writing as thing to start with for exercising.
I think you should be able to run the code, since the source I refer to should be there or at least. But I did not run it on an other computer so far. So I can not promise anything.

It is a beginning and I send you an email, when it is really worth looking into it. But if you are curious, go ahead, I have nothing to hide :-)
